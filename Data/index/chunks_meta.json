Translation of the executive summary and language editing Strategic Agenda v Glossary The entries in this glossary are primarily taken or modified from definitions provided by reports published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or previous editions of the Adaptation Gap Report. Adaptation: The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects (IPCC 2022).1 Adaptation costs: Costs of planning, preparing for, facilitating and implementing adaptation measures, including transaction costs (IPCC 2007).2 Adaptation gap: The difference between actually implemented adaptation and a societally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to tolerated climate change impacts and reflecting resource limitations and competing priorities (UNEP 2014).3 Adaptation limits: The point at which an actor\u2019s objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions (IPCC 2022).1 Hard adaptation limit: No adaptive actions are possible to avoid intolerable risks. Soft adaptation limit: Options are currently not available to avoid intolerable",

Soft adaptation limit: Options are currently not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action. Adaptive capacity: The ability of systems, institutions, humans and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences (IPCC 2022).1 Exposure: The presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural assets, in places and settings that could be adversely affected (IPCC 2022).1 Impacts: The consequences of realized risks on natural and human systems, where risks result from the interactions of climate-related hazards (including extreme weather and climate events), exposure and vulnerability. Impacts generally refer to effects on lives; livelihoods; health and well-being; ecosystems and species; economic, social and cultural assets; services (including ecosystem services); and infrastructure. Impacts may be referred to as consequences or outcomes, and can be adverse or beneficial (IPCC 2022).1 Maladaptation: Actions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased vulnerability to climate change, diminished welfare, or increased greenhouse gas emissions, now or in the future. Maladaptation is usually an unintended consequence (IPCC 2022).1 Mitigation (of climate change): A human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases (IPCC 2022).1 Resilience: The capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure. Resilience is a positive attribute when it maintains capacity for adaptation, learning and/or transformation (IPCC 2022).1 Residual risk: The risk related to climate change impacts that remains following adaptation and mitigation efforts. Adaptation actions can redistribute risk and impacts, with increased risk and impacts in some areas or populations, and decreased risk and impacts in others (IPCC 2022).1 Risk: The potential for consequences where something of value is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values. In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions between climate-related hazards with the exposure and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system to the hazards (IPCC 2014; IPCC 2022).4,1 Hazard: The potential occurrence of a natural or human- induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems and environmental resources (IPCC 2022).1 Vulnerability: The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected.

As action to cut greenhouse gas emissions continues to lag, these impacts are going to intensify, harming more people \u2013 particularly the poor and vulnerable \u2013 and causing huge economic damage. Developed nations know this. They also know they should be financially supporting developing countries, which are least responsible for the climate crisis. This is enshrined in the Paris Agreement. Subsequently, the Glasgow Climate Pact called for developed countries to finance adaptation in developing countries to the tune of US$40 billion per year by 2025, while the new collective quantified goal for climate finance (NCQG) called for at least US$300 billion to finance both mitigation and adaptation per year by 2035.

Yet UNEP\u2019s Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on Empty shows this finance is not coming. The estimated adaptation finance needs of developing countries range from US$310 billion to US$365 billion per year by 2035. Meanwhile, international public adaptation finance flows from developed to developing countries fell from US$28 billion in 2022 to US$26 billion in 2023. While the numbers for 2024 and 2025 are not yet available, one thing is clear: unless trends in adaptation financing turn around, which currently seems unlikely, the Glasgow Climate Pact goal will not be achieved, the NCQG will not be achieved, and many more people will suffer needlessly. There are signs of hope. Some 172 countries have national adaptation policies, strategies or plans in place. In the first biennial transparency reports submitted under the Paris Agreement, countries reported over 1,600 adaptation actions, mostly on biodiversity, agriculture, water and infrastructure. Support for new projects under the Adaptation Fund, the Global Environment Facility and the Green Climate Fund also grew in 2024. With the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap, which will be considered at COP 30 in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, we have the chance to enable the raising of US$1.3 trillion per year by 2035. But for the Roadmap to work, mitigation must pick up to minimize climate impacts, new finance providers and instruments must come on board, and climate resilience must become an integral part of financial decision-making. The Roadmap must also focus on grants, and concessional and non-debt-creating instruments, to avoid increasing the debt burden of vulnerable nations. The private sector can also do more. The Adaptation Gap Report estimates the potential for private sector investment in national public adaptation priorities at approximately US$50 billion per year \u2013 a big step up from the current financing of roughly US$5 billion. As nations prepare to meet at COP 30, this report delivers a clear message: we need a global push to increase adaptation finance from both public and private sources. Budgets may be tight. There may be many competing priorities. But the smart choice is to invest in adaptation now \u2013 to minimize loss of life, to soften damage to infrastructure and, ultimately, to protect economies from the stronger climate impacts that are approaching over the horizon.

Inger Andersen Executive Director United Nations Environment Programme ix Executive summary A global effort is needed to implement ambitious climate action in view of accelerating climate impacts. Action on adaptation is still inadequate. Although there is clear evidence of accelerating climate impacts, changing geopolitical priorities and increasing fiscal constraints are making it more challenging to mobilize the resources needed for climate mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage. The lack of resources, action and global attention will result in higher global long-term temperatures and associated climate impacts and risks. Yet investments in climate action far outweigh the costs of inaction. For instance, every US$1 spent on coastal protection avoids US$14 in damages; urban nature-based solutions reduce ambient temperatures by over 1\u00b0C on average, a significant improvement during the summer heat; and health-related capacity-building can further reduce symptoms of heat stress. The Adaptation Gap Report (AGR) series provides regular updates on what is happening globally in planning, implementation and finance for adaptation to climate change, informing the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations ahead of the annual Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP). This year\u2019s report finds that: \u25b6 \u25b6 \u25b6 \u25b6 The adaptation finance needs of developing countries by 2035 are at least 12 times as much as current international public adaptation finance flows The Glasgow Climate Pact goal of doubling 2019 adaptation finance flows by 2025 to approximately US$40 billion will be missed if current trends continue The new collective quantified goal for climate finance (NCQG) is insufficient to meet developing countries\u2019 adaptation finance needs in 2035 There is evidence of improving adaptation planning and implementation, but it is limited A global collective effort \u2013 a \u201cmutir\u00e3o global\u201d as called for by the Brazilian COP 30 Presidency \u2013 is needed to bridge the finance gap and accelerate climate action, with both public and private finance having to step up. The AGR 2025 reflects on opportunities for the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T and the private sector to contribute to this effort. 1 Status of adaptation planning and implementation Progress in adaptation planning is visible but patchy. Planning is critical to minimize and address current and future climate risks effectively. Having in place national planning instruments is therefore an important indicator of progress towards the global goal on adaptation. A total of 172 out of 197 countries worldwide have a national adaptation plan, strategy or policy in place (figure ES.1). Out of the 25 that do not, only four have not started developing one. However, 36 countries possess plans that are outdated or have not been updated for a decade, which calls into question their relevance and effectiveness under present day",

However, 36 countries possess plans that are outdated or have not been updated for a decade, which calls into question their relevance and effectiveness under present day or future conditions. This could be an indication that countries encounter difficulties in updating these plans in a timely manner, which should be addressed with urgency to minimize the possibility of maladaptation. Countries are also showing progress in the mainstreaming of adaptation into relevant plans and strategies, which constitutes the other element of the United Arab Emirates Framework for Global Climate Resilience (UAE FGCR) target on adaptation planning. Most small island developing States (SIDS) have strongly integrated adaptation into their national development plans and strategies, demonstrating that \u2013 within these countries \u2013 adaptation is deeply embedded within broader development planning processes. Similarly, although evidence of mainstreaming is often weakly reported on in biennial transparency reports (BTRs), and should be strengthened in the reports due in 2026, 59 per cent of countries still report on at least one instance of integrating adaptation into a non-climate plan or strategy, suggesting that progress in adaptation mainstreaming is being made by a wider constituency of countries. x Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty Figure ES.1 Progress towards achieving the UAE FGCR\u2019s target of all country Parties having national adaptation planning instruments in place by 2030 s e i r t n u o c f o r e b m u N 197 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 25 countries without an instrument 36 countries without an instrument that is under 10 years old or within its stated period of validity 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025* Countries with a national adaptation planning instrument in place Countries with a national planning instrument in place under 10 years old and within its period of validity National adaptation planning instruments published each year * Until 31 August 2025 The funds under the UNFCCC mark record disbursement, and adaptation implementation is progressing, but gaps remain.

This is an increase of 86 per cent compared to the five-year moving average of US$494 million between 2019 and 2023. However, this may not be a trend, with financial constraints likely to rise beyond 2025. Implementation of national adaptation plans, policies and strategies to reduce the social and economic impacts of relevant climate hazards is one of the UAE FGCR targets. Thus, tracking progress towards this objective is critical to achieving the global goal on adaptation. To meet that end, the UNFCCC-mandated BTRs, which were due at the end of 2024, are the most comprehensive national source of information on adaptation implementation worldwide available. However, while 94 of 105 available BTRs address adaptation, most least developed countries (LDCs) and SIDS, as well as a majority of African countries, have yet to submit one, and the coverage of adaptation varies widely (figure ES.2). xi Executive summary Figure ES.2 Global distribution of countries that have submitted a BTR with detailed information on climate impacts and adaptation, and the number of data points per country a. b.

In view of the timeline for the NCQG, it is pertinent to reassess the adaptation finance gap and align it with the year 2035. The reanalysis estimates the costs of adaptation to be in a plausible central range of US$310\u2013365 billion per year for developing countries by the year 2035 (in 2023 prices).1 The range reflects evidence from an updated modelling analysis of adaptation costs, as well as an updated assessment of submitted adaptation finance needs based on NAPs and NDCs, with extrapolation to all developing countries. Contrasting this, the latest available international public adaptation finance flows from developed country Parties to developing country Parties were tracked at US$26 billion in 2023 (constant 2023 prices). This is a slight decline compared to 2022, and was due to a drop in funding from the multilateral development banks.2 This levelling off of finance, and recent policy announcements on the reduction of official development assistance, suggests that the Glasgow Climate Pact goal of doubling international public adaptation finance from 2019 levels to around US$40 billion by 2025 will be missed if current trends continue. Comparing the estimated adaptation finance needs with the current finance flows shows that the adaptation finance gap is now US$284\u2013339 billion per year until 2035, with needs that are 12\u201314 times as much as current finance flows (figure ES.3). The more positive news is that the adaptation finance gap is lower for LDCs and SIDS, though the levels still fall far below needs for these most vulnerable countries. 1 2 The range is significantly smaller than that presented in the AGR 2023 (US$215\u2013387 billion per year until 2030 in constant 2021 prices), which is due to updated and extended modelling analysis and more costed country needs, but little of this is related to the different time frame. This includes only the share corresponding to flows from developed country Parties to developing country Parties. If all finance flows are considered, the volume of international public adaptation finance rises to US$35 billion in 2023, reflecting the important contribution of developing country Parties to adaptation finance \u2013 around 30 per cent. xiii Executive summary Figure ES.3 Comparison of adaptation financing needs, modelled costs and international public adaptation finance flows in developing countries Adaptation financing needs (NDCs/NAPs) (US$365 billion/year up to 2035) Modelled costs of adaptation (US$310 billion/year by 2035) s e i r t n u o c g n p o e v e",

Domestic and private finance flows are excluded. Debt instruments are growing in prominence and non-concessional loans exceeded concessional loans, raising concerns of long-term affordability and equity. As well as the volume of finance, the mix of financial instruments is important, especially in terms of the NCQG text which highlights the need for concessional finance. Although 70 per cent of international public adaptation finance was concessional in 2022\u20132023, 3 it is worrisome that debt instruments continue to dominate these overall flows, comprising 58 per cent on average in 2022\u20132023. In particular, the increasing proportion of non-concessionary debt instruments raises concerns about long-term affordability, equity, and the risk of an \u2018adaptation investment trap\u2019 where the rising climate disasters increase indebtedness and make it harder for countries to invest in adaptation. This is particularly true for vulnerable countries, especially LDCs and SIDS, which have contributed very little to the climate crisis but suffer the most from its effects. Further, non-concessional loans exceeded concessional ones, albeit so far predominantly to middle-income countries.4 The NCQG is insufficient to meet adaptation finance needs. During COP 29 in Baku, the NCQG set the goal, with developed country Parties taking the lead in mobilizing at least US$300 billion per year by 2035 to developing country Parties for climate action.5 At first glance, this target appears significantly higher than the previous goal for developed countries to mobilize US$100 billion by 2020 for developing countries. However, this new goal is clearly insufficient to meet adaptation finance needs in 2035 for two reasons. First, the NCQG is not adjusted for inflation, and therefore represents US$300 billion in the year 2035. To compare on an equivalent basis, it is necessary to take account of possible future inflation.

For example, adjusting the AGR adaptation finance needs of US$310\u2013365 billion per year (in constant 2023 prices) at a 3 per cent inflation rate (the average rate over the last decade) would increase these needs to US$440\u2013520 billion annually by the year 2035. Second, the NCQG covers both mitigation and adaptation, and so far no adaptation subgoal has been agreed during UNFCCC negotiations. The AGR 2025 has assessed possible scenarios for a minimum and maximum level of adaptation finance in 2035, finding that under both scenarios, the adaptation finance gap cannot be closed with international public finance alone. 3 4 5 Either in the form of grants or as concessional loans with very low interest rates and long grace periods/maturity timelines. For LDCs, the distribution was balanced between grants (51 per cent) and debt instruments (49 per cent), with non-concessional debt more limited (10 per cent); for SIDS, the proportions were grants (55 per cent), concessional (17 per cent) and non-concessional (26 per cent) loans, with the higher figure for the latter due to income-based eligibility limits. The US$300 billion goal was embedded within the much larger Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T, a call for action to scale up finance to at least US$1.3 trillion annually in 2035 to developing country Parties. xiv Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty 3 Bridging the adaptation finance gap Private sector finance can help fill the gap, though its overall contribution is likely to be modest. AGR 2025 has looked at the potential for the private sector to play a role in filling the adaptation finance gap. To do this, it has developed a typology to assess the types of adaptation and the associated roles of the public and the private sector (figure ES.4), and used this for a detailed country, sector and activity analysis. The aggregated results indicate that for the types of national adaptation activities prioritized in NAPs and NDCs (columns A and B of the figure, which relate to the AGR finance needs of US$310\u2013365 billion/year), around three quarters are typically funded by the public sector. These include public goods, such as major flood protection investments or cash transfers (column A), and other investments and services dominated by the public sector today. However, the other quarter involves adaptation activities where there is a role for the private sector, such as climate smart agriculture (column B). Adjusting this down for the realistic potential, the AGR 2025 estimates that the private sector could deliver approximately 15\u201320 per cent of total national",

However, the other quarter involves adaptation activities where there is a role for the private sector, such as climate smart agriculture (column B). Adjusting this down for the realistic potential, the AGR 2025 estimates that the private sector could deliver approximately 15\u201320 per cent of total national adaptation funding needs (US$50 billion/ year of the US$310\u2013365 billion/year by 2035). However, the relative private share will vary strongly between countries and sectors. It will be higher for upper-middle-income countries and likely to be much lower for low-income countries; it will also be predominantly in certain sectors, in particular for agriculture, water and infrastructure. Moreover, as current private sector flows are low, with tracked levels at ca US$5 billion per year, even reaching this level will require targeted policy action. It is also likely to require blended finance solutions where public finance is used to de-risk and scale up private investment. Due to lower leverage and mobilization ratios for adaptation compared to mitigation, significant volumes of concessionary public finance are likely to be needed to deliver this private sector investment. Under column C of figure ES.4 there are additional adaptation actions to be funded by the private sector, such as climate-proofing private sector assets. Parties do not ask for financial support for these investments in NAPs or NDCs, and they sit outside the AGR estimates, though they will involve large additional costs for the private sector, estimated indicatively at more than US$250 billion per year.6 Figure ES.4 Simplified categorization of adaptation types and opportunities for private sector engagement Activities covered by the AGR\u2019s adaptation cost / finance needs estimates (US$310\u2013365 billion/year) Private adaptation costs additional to the AGR estimates (estimated at >US$250 billion/year) A.

There is growing interest in innovative approaches that might scale up private investment in adaptation. The AGR 2025 has analysed the latest information available on adaptation accelerators, incubators and platforms to identify new private sector adaptation solutions, finance instruments and business models. This revealed many innovative approaches, but reinforces the findings above, in that opportunities are concentrated in the agriculture sector, and most innovation is focused on middle-income countries. Moreover, insufficient attention has been given to the distinction between financing and funding because the majority of innovative approaches transfer the costs of adaptation back to the developing countries or households. Therefore, while they reduce the financing gap (i.e. who provides the money), they do not reduce the funding gap (i.e. who ultimately pays). The AGR 2025 contends that this issue needs to be brought out more transparently in negotiation discussions.7 The Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T must guide bridging the adaptation finance gap fairly and without enhancing vulnerabilities of developing nations. The Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to scale up finance to US$1.3 trillion was established in 2024 during COP 29 as part of the NCQG, with the intent of enabling more climate action in developing countries in support of low-emissions climate- resilient development pathways. This includes implementing NDCs and NAPs through grants, concessional and non- debt-creating instruments to avoid enhancing vulnerabilities and inequities. The AGR 2025 provides reflections for the forthcoming negotiations to strengthen the Roadmap: First, by containing the growth of the adaptation finance gap through mitigation and avoided maladaptation. For example, the roadmap could point at the importance of removing fossil fuel subsidies and reducing investments in fossil fuel infrastructure in line with the global stocktake\u2019s call to transition away from fossil fuels. It could also provide guidance on avoiding maladaptation, for example by addressing the root causes of vulnerability, such as through fair allocation of finance within countries, enhancing capacities and access to resources, addressing unequal power dynamics, and ensuring adaptation is locally led. Second, by increasing the volume of adaptation finance with the help of new providers and instruments. This could include expanding the sources and modalities for support beyond grants and loans. Additional climate finance providers could also support bridging the gap. Several countries not listed among the",

Second, by increasing the volume of adaptation finance with the help of new providers and instruments. This could include expanding the sources and modalities for support beyond grants and loans. Additional climate finance providers could also support bridging the gap. Several countries not listed among the developed countries with the capacity and resources to do so are already supporting developing countries through the provision of adaptation finance. The roadmap could identify possible instruments and ways in which additional actors can voluntarily contribute to closing the adaptation finance gap in transparent and accountable ways. Third, by engaging more finance actors in integrating climate resilience into financial decision-making. The roadmap could identify ways for actors such as central banks, commercial banks, credit rating agencies and export credit agencies to consider resilience in decisions on lending and rating more strongly. This would help manage physical risks and increase adaptation. However, there are critical issues of fairness that need to be considered to avoid increasing perceived investment risks and negative biases against the most vulnerable populations and nations. 4 Summary To achieve the objectives of the global goal on adaptation, public and private actors need to step up financial support in line with the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap. While there are signs of mainstreaming adaptation into broader national development planning and implementing adaptation in priority sectors and areas, not enough can be said about the effectiveness and adequacy of adaptation actions. This will be critically important for the assessment of progress towards the global goal on adaptation in the second global stocktake. It can be supported by aligning reporting in the second BTRs with the UAE FGCR, and strengthening their quality by considering the opportunities for improvement as described in this report. Meanwhile, it is far too evident that the financial resources needed to enable adaptation action in developing countries at the scale necessary to meet the growing challenges of current and future climate risks is woefully inadequate. It will take nothing less than a global collective effort to increase climate finance to the levels articulated in the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T. This is particularly salient because the potential for private sector finance to contribute is moderate, and needs targeted policy action and blended finance to be accessible. 7 A smaller number of innovation models showed the potential to help fund as well as finance adaptation because their cost recovery models generate new benefit streams which can also help fund adaptation; further analysis of their potential is a priority. xvi Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty Tropical Cyclone Tino hits Tuvalu, 17 January 2020.

Photo: \u00a9 Climate Visuals Countdown 1 1.1 Introductory narrative The new nationally determined contributions (NDCs) point towards global warming that is far beyond the Paris Agreement temperature goal of stabilized +1.5\u00b0C (global mean relative to pre-industrial levels). Climate impacts will accelerate beyond +1.5\u00b0C, making it increasingly challenging to manage climate risks (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2022). Every fraction of a degree of reduced warming we achieve through mitigation will limit adaptation needs. At the same time, the current geopolitical tensions and cuts to overseas development assistance, among other factors, are making it increasingly difficult to mobilize the political will and resources necessary to address mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage. improve investments This lays the foundation for our shared mission to in adaptation accelerate and planning, implementation and means of implementation (finance, technology development and transfer, capacity- building), given that investing in adaptation is good value for money. The science conclusively shows that adaptation significantly reduces the costs of climate impacts, enhances resilience and leads to improved development outcomes, from local, to national, to global levels (IPCC 2022; United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2023; Brandon et al. 2025). For example, investing in agricultural or coastal resilience leads to manyfold returns in food security or coastal protection over inaction (Sulser et al. 2021; UNFCCC 2023), and ambitious adaptation can halve global climate risk under any warming scenario (Magnan et al. 2021; Marbaix et al. 2025). Adaptation also minimizes the increasing burden on future generations and the most vulnerable (World Bank 2024), such as women and girls pushed into poverty, food insecurity and hunger as a result of climate change (United Nations Programme for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women 2024). Financing adaptation should be seen as an investment with important dividends (Brandon et al. 2025).

Contributing to this debate on current and future adaptation requires regular science-based assessments of global adaptation progress, which the Adaptation Gap Report series aims to contribute to (see box 1.1). Key discussions of this year\u2019s Adaptation Gap Report touch on a diversity of interconnected topics: ambition of the revised NDCs vis-\u00e0-vis progress reported in the Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs); assessment of progress towards the achievement of the targets of the United Arab Emirates-Framework for Global Climate Resilience (UAE FGCR) under the global goal on adaptation (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2024) with a particular focus on mainstreaming; and assessment of progress of climate finance, including the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance (NCQG) of US$300 billion, and the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap relative to the adaptation finance gap. All of these are of considerable relevance to the thirtieth session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 30) in Bel\u00e9m, where the Brazilian presidency is calling for a mutir\u00e3o global, a global collective effort, to move from negotiations to ambitious climate action (COP 30 Presidency 2025). Box 1.1 Structure of the Adaptation Gap Report \u25cf Chapter 1 gives a brief overview of the current scientific and policy landscape in understanding climate impacts and the value of adaptation, and highlights the connection with the international negotiation landscape under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement (figure 1.1). \u25cf Chapter 3 on global progress on adaptation implementation assesses efforts in adaptation action, particularly based on an analysis of the BTRs, to inform opportunities for improved reporting in the context of the UAE FGCR and towards the second global stocktake. \u25cf Chapter 2 on global progress on adaptation planning assesses efforts towards some of the targets of the UAE FGCR related to the iterative adaptation cycle, as well as how these targets contribute to climate - resilient development through mainstreaming into national, subnational and sectoral policy processes. \u25cf Finally, chapter 4 on the adaptation finance gap informs the discussions around finance flows towards the Glasgow Climate Pact\u2019s goal of doubling adaptation finance by 2025, the NCQG and the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T.

A recent modelling study shows, for example, that the effectiveness of water-related adaptation declines from 90 per cent under <+1.5\u00b0C to 69 per cent and 46 per cent at +2\u00b0C and +4\u00b0C respectively (Lissner et al. 2024). The transition from adaptation aspiration to actual implementation at the local level remains too slow (IPCC 2022), with numerous constraints and emerging hard limits being reported in the literature (Berrang-Ford et al. 2021), especially when it comes to technological and ecosystem-based action (Thomas et al. 2021). The range of available adaptation options is at risk of shrinking with warming (Haasnoot et al. 2021). Hasty responses can result in maladaptation, that is, an insidious increase of climate risks over time and/or space (Juhola and K\u00e4yhk\u00f6 2023; Reckien et al. 2023a), with incidence in intensifying inequalities. Current interventions often fail to account for cascading and compounding climate risks (Alc\u00e1ntara-Ayala 2025; Duvat forthcoming). Engagement of stakeholders in adaptation remains insufficient (Petzold et al. 2023). are reported in a growing number of publications analysing health-related adaptation interventions (Hamimatunnisa et al. 2025). There has also been significant progress on the policy front since the adoption of the Paris Agreement 10 years ago, both in the climate negotiation process and as a result of international cooperation (Leiter 2022; Canales et al. 2023). Despite room for improvement at national and local levels (Hurlimann, Moosavi and Browne 2021; Wannewitz et al. 2024; Hussein et al. 2025), such progress has helped accelerate the support of adaptation planning instruments and improve the capacity of countries to identify adaptation priorities and needs in relation to costs and means of implementation (UNEP 2024). 1.3 Policy progress, with a focus on the UNFCCC arena Major progress also",

In particular, the adoption of the UAE FGCR including the development and implementation of national adaptation plans (NAPs), as well as assessing progress through advanced monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) systems by 2030, represented a step change towards achieving the global goal on adaptation (figure 1.1). One key outcome has been the agreement on 11 global adaptation targets covering the four dimensions of the iterative adaptation cycle (impact, vulnerability and risk assessment; planning; implementation; and MEL \u2013 with a 2030 time-horizon) and seven globally relevant themes (water, food and agriculture, health, ecosystems and biodiversity, infrastructure, poverty alleviation and livelihoods, and cultural heritage; see icons in figure 1.1, panel C). A number of cross-cutting considerations, such as gender, participation, transparency, human rights, intergenerational equity and social justice, Indigenous peoples and local communities, children, youth, and persons with disabilities, have been recognized as key to the implementation of the UAE FGCR. A two-year UAE- Bel\u00e9m work programme to identify or develop indicators to track these targets was established, including a convening of technical experts that has proposed a list of 100 globally relevant indicators (Indicator Expert Group 2025a; Indicator Expert Group 2025b). The list of indicators will be considered for adoption at COP 30. On a more positive note, recent studies show, for example, that nature-based solutions can help reduce air temperature in urban areas by 1.1\u00b0C average across cities and towns (Ferrario et al. 2024), and that significant improvements in heat literacy and a reduction in heat-related symptoms Progress also includes the IPCC developing Technical Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Including Indicators, Metrics and Methodologies as par t of its Seventh Assessment Repor t (IPCC 2025, pp. 14\u201315). 3 Chapter 1 \u2013 The political and scientific context Another major advance is the establishment of loss and damage-related institutions, such as the Santiago Network1 and the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (Wyns 2022; Klinsky and Moffett 2025).

While this fund addresses residual losses beyond adaptation limits (figure 1.1, panel B), its establishment marks a significant evolution in the broader climate finance landscape. While adaptation has progressed within the United Nations climate regime, the negotiations landscape has become increasingly complex. This complexity is not a result of a growing number of agenda items, which have remained relatively constant over the last decade.2 Instead, it stems from the considerable increase in time and negotiation slots allocated to each existing item, reflecting the renewed interest in adaptation and its political significance as a result of the urgency (Allen and Bhandary 2024).3 Growing complexity, however, also makes it harder for people outside of the international policy circle to understand advances and progress, and therefore ultimately limits the perception of the social impact of climate multilateralism. COP 30 faces a negotiation agenda with a strong presence of adaptation, including the expected adoption of the indicators of the UAE FGCR, and its link with the NCQG and other adaptation finance considerations. At the same time, the call in the first global stocktake for all countries to have NAPs in place by 2025, laying the groundwork for the start of the second global stocktake of collective progress and its linkage with the enhanced transparency framework, and in particular, with the adaptation documents that allow understanding the progress of the Parties vis-\u00e0- vis their plans and the global targets, especially BTRs (see chapter 3).

The item on the NWP was only considered during the Subsidiary Bodies in June 2024. Impacts, vulnerability and risk assessment (IVRA) Poverty alleviation and livelihoods BTRs For example, negotiations on the global goal on adaptation now refer not only to the UAE FGCR and its associated indicator programme, but also to communication and reporting instruments such as the adaptation component of BTRs and its associated technical expert review, as well as the strengthening of the national MEL systems to inform collective assessments of progress such as the global stocktake. The global goal on adaptation agenda has also grown to involve the Baku Adaptation Roadmap, \u201cenabling conditions\u201d and \u201cmeans of implementation\u201d, particularly the finance needed to meet the targets; and the urgency of accelerating adaptation both through incremental and transformational adaptation.

Among the 25 countries still without a national adaptation plan, strategy or policy, 21 have initiated a process of developing one, although half of these processes have been under way for 7\u201310 years. Of the 172 countries with a national adaptation planning instrument in place, 36 (21 per cent) possess instruments that are either expired or have not been updated in at least a decade, calling into question the relevance and effectiveness of these instruments and indicating that countries are having difficulties in updating them in a timely manner. Countries without a national adaptation planning instrument in place or with instruments that are dated and/or expired are predominantly developing countries, suggesting that financial, technical and human resource constraints inhibit national adaptation planning. Least developed countries are more likely than small island developing States (SIDS) and other developing countries to have up-to-date instruments, suggesting that support for national adaptation planning has been relatively effective in targeting these countries. In addition to developing dedicated national adaptation planning instruments, mainstreaming adaptation into policies, plans and strategies is part of the UAE FGCR target on planning, reflecting its complementary and mutually reinforcing role in institutionalizing risk-informed decision-making. An analysis of national development plans and strategies in SIDS reveals a relatively high level of adaptation integration into these flagship development policies, indicating a promising shift towards embedding adaptation within broader development planning. Furthermore, the integration of adaptation into sectors that are not traditionally associated with being climate-sensitive or adaptation-relevant by a number of SIDS demonstrates that they possess an understanding that adaptation is relevant to many aspects of national prosperity. A broader analysis of countries\u2019 first biennial transparency reports finds that countries are not reporting on mainstreaming efforts systematically, which will severely limit the extent to which global progress can be tracked by processes such as the global stocktake. 2.1 Introduction With climate impacts accelerating and outpacing many existing risk management efforts, effective planning is one of our strongest lines of defence. This is why the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process has increasingly recognized its critical role in climate action over the last 15 years \u2013 from establishing the national adaptation plan (NAP) process in 2010 (UNFCCC 2011) to establishing a target on planning under the framework for the global goal on adaptation, also known as the United Arab Emirates Framework for Global Climate Resilience (UAE FGCR). Specifically, this target states that \u201cby 2030 all Parties have in place country-driven, gender-responsive, participatory and fully transparent national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and planning processes and/or strategies, covering, as appropriate, ecosystems, sectors, people and vulnerable communities, and have mainstreamed adaptation in all relevant strategies and plans\u201d (UNFCCC 2024). This policy evolution has been reinforced by dedicated finance, including through the Global Environment Facility for adaptation planning efforts in least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS), the Green Climate Fund establishing a window of support on adaptation planning in 2016, and various other support initiatives. 8 Adaptation Gap",

Since the agreement of the UAE FGCR in 2023, this annual assessment has taken on greater significance, as it speaks directly to the framework\u2019s aforementioned target on national adaptation planning. Following this core analysis, the chapter also provides novel insights into the mainstreaming element of this target, investigating progress made by countries in integrating adaptation into relevant national, sectoral and subnational policy processes. The chapter does this through two complimentary analyses. First, it analyses the national development plans and strategies of SIDS to assess the extent to which these countries are integrating adaptation into their flagship development policy instruments. Second, it analyses biennial transparency reports (BTRs) to evaluate how these reports can be leveraged to track progress in mainstreaming adaptation into policy processes across different levels and sectors.1 The cut-off for data collection analysed in this chapter is 31 August 2025. A detailed description of the methodology underlying the analyses presented in this chapter can be found in annex 2. 2.2 Global status of national adaptation planning As in previous years\u2019 AGRs, this chapter provides a global status of national adaptation planning, tracking the publication of national plans, strategies and policies for adaptation (referred to as \u2018national adaptation planning instruments\u2019 \u2013 see box 2.1) by countries. In addition to tracking the publication of instruments, this year\u2019s analysis also assesses the current status and extent to which countries have been successful in updating these planning instruments in a timely manner. The iterative element of adaptation planning is not captured by the UAE FGCR\u2019s target on adaptation planning. However, given the growing severity of scientific projections for future climate impacts anticipated by successive IPCC assessment reports and rapidly changing current national and international socioeconomic contexts, it is crucial that national adaptation planning instruments are regularly reviewed and updated so they can remain relevant and effective (Parson and Karwat 2011; Watkiss, Hunt and Savage 2014; Woodruff 2016; Schinko et al. 2017; European Commission 2023; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2024a; UNFCCC Least Developed Countries Expert Group [UNFCCC LEG] 2025).

The methodology underlying this assessment found in annex 2.A. is Box 2.1 Defining the national adaptation planning instruments and their relationship with NAPs submitted to the UNFCCC The term national adaptation planning instruments is used as a catch-all term that covers policies, strategies and plans that are designed to guide/drive a country\u2019s national adaptation process. These instruments can be exclusively adaptation-focused or jointly address adaptation and mitigation. Furthermore, the function of national planning instruments can vary in scope. Some \u2013 often referred to as strategies and policies \u2013 perform a strategic function, providing countries with a general framework for coordinating adaptation efforts at the national level (e.g. a vision for adaptation, adaptation objectives, and principles for how adaptation should be implemented). Others \u2013 often referred to as plans, action plans and programmes \u2013 are more implementation-focused, translating a country\u2019s higher-level strategy into concrete activities (OECD 2024a). Finally, some instruments perform both of these functions, which is often the case with NAPs developed through the NAP process as defined and mandated by the UNFCCC (Hammill et al. 2021).2 Meanwhile, \u2018NAPs submitted to the UNFCCC\u2019 are national adaptation planning instruments that countries have submitted to the UNFCCC, and are subsequently made available on NAP Central \u2013 a UNFCCC-hosted database of NAPs. Since their establishment under the UNFCCC in 2010, an increasing number of countries have formulated \u2013 or are in the process of formulating \u2013 a NAP. As at 31 August 2025, 64 developing and 11 developed countries are submitted NAPs to UNFCCC, while a further 70 developing countries are in the process of formulating a NAP (UNFCCC 2025). 1 2 This chapter was co-financed by Irish Aid (note that the ideas, opinions and comments therein are entirely the responsibility of its author[s] and do not necessarily represent or reflect the Government of Ireland\u2019s policy). To be counted in this analysis, instruments need to have a cross-sectoral purview (i.e. instruments that focus on single or specific groups of sectors will not be counted) and have a medium- to long-term outlook (meaning that national adaptation programmes of actions or similar adaptation programmes/investment plans that are intended to be one-off processes, and are therefore short-term in nature, are not counted). 9 Chapter 2 \u2013 Global progress on adaptation planning Progress in preparing national adaptation planning instruments The first national adaptation policy was published in 2002.

Analyses presented in the 2020\u20132024 editions of the AGR however, have consistently shown that while countries are continuing to prepare new planning instruments (see grey bars in figure 2.1), progress towards all countries having a national adaptation plan, strategy or policy in place has slowed significantly over this period; rising from 159 countries in 2020, to 171 countries in 2024.3 This year\u2019s analysis shows that over the last year there has been no material change in this trend, with the total number of countries with a national adaptation planning instrument in place increasing by one to 172 countries (87 per cent \u2013 see green line in figure 2.1).

Information about when these processes started is available for 19 of the 21 countries, with the time between the start of the process and the time of writing varying between 2 and 10 years, with the arithmetic mean and median being 6.7 and 7 years respectively. Progress in updating national adaptation planning instruments Previous editions of the AGR demonstrated that countries are actively engaged in updating their initial adaptation instruments and/or supplementing them planning with complementary policies, strategies or plans. Last year\u2019s report found that 101 countries (51 per cent) had developed a second planning instrument and 29 countries (20 per cent) had developed a third (United Nations Environment Programme 2024). Similarly, as at 31 August 2025, of the 64 developing countries that have submitted their NAPS to the UNFCCC, six have an updated version (NAP Global Network 2025). While this trend is encouraging, this year\u2019s analysis finds that the instruments of over a fifth (21 per cent) of countries with a national adaptation planning instrument in place are either more than 10 years old and/or have expired according to their stated period of validity, which calls into question the relevance and effectiveness of these instruments, and may suggest that countries are having difficulties in updating them in a timely manner (see red line in figure 2.1).5 3 4 The figure for 2024 is until 5 August. Last year\u2019s AGR reported that 10 countries had yet to initiate a process to develop a national planning instrument. Since then, new data supplied by the UNFCCC secretariat has indicated that there is evidence that six of these had in fact started the process of developing a national adaptation planning instrument, this information however was not included in national submissions to the UNFCCC for these countries. 5 A national adaptation planning instrument\u2019s period of validity was determined by reviewing the document (see methodology in annex 2.A for the criteria applied). In cases where the document did not provide the information required to determine the instrument\u2019s period of validity, it was given a period of validity of 10 years from the date it was published or declared active. 10 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty Progress across country classifications Disaggregation by country classifications commonly used under the Paris Agreement (developed countries, developing countries, SIDS and LDCs) indicates that challenges in developing a first national planning instrument and keeping these instruments up to date are most predominantly felt by developing countries, with only one developed country (2 per cent) having no plan, strategy or policy in place, and four (10 per cent) having a planning instrument in place that is expired or over 10 years old (figure 2.2).6 These findings support the view that financial, technical and human resource constraints \u2013 which are more prevalent within developing countries \u2013 are an important factor inhibiting national adaptation planning processes.

While featuring in the UAE FGCR\u2019s target on adaptation planning, there are presently no studies that provide a global assessment of the progress countries are making in adaptation mainstreaming. The novel analyses presented in sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 aim to inform and shine light on how progress in mainstreaming adaptation into relevant plans and strategies can be assessed in future studies. Prior to presenting this analysis, this section provides an introduction to adaptation mainstreaming, Framing adaptation mainstreaming Adaptation mainstreaming is broadly understood to be the integration of adaptation objectives and climate risk considerations into the established functions, policy and practice of government institutions to build climate resilience. It complements and reinforces dedicated adaptation planning in governing adaptation as a policy issue (Rogers, Adams and Byrne 2023). 6 In this analysis, the term developed countries refers to country Parties to the UNFCCC included on the list of Annex I countries in the Kyoto Protocol. The term developing countries refers to all other country Parties to the UNFCCC that are not included on that list. 7 Information presented in this subsection was obtained through a systematic literature.

The methodology applied is found in annex 2.B. 11 Chapter 2 \u2013 Global progress on adaptation planning While there is broad consensus around this definition, within literature, the precise relationship between dedicated adaptation planning and mainstreaming is not always clearly articulated, with dedicated adaptation planning sometimes being framed as a form of mainstreaming, and other times as being conceptually distinct (Uittenbroek et al. 2014; Dewulf, Meijerinkand and Runhaar 2015; Mogelgaard et al. 2018; Runhaar et al. 2018; Gim and Shin 2023). \u25b6 \u25b6 Within the context of the UNFCCC, however, the two are conceptually distinct but explicitly interconnected, with the facilitation of adaptation mainstreaming into relevant policy processes being one of the two stated objectives of the NAP process.8 Under this framing, planning instruments identify the priority risks and actions that should be mainstreamed into national, sectoral and subnational policies, while the planning process clarifies institutional roles, costs, regulatory reforms, capacity needs and desired outcomes of adaptation action, which should be embedded in broader policies and systems. Mainstreaming is an effective approach for addressing issues \u2013 like adaptation \u2013 that cut across sectoral boundaries, governance levels and policy areas (Lafferty and Hovden 2003). The main advantages of mainstreaming include: \u25b6 Ensuring policy coherence and synergies, where the benefits of adaptation are linked to the pursuit of other development priorities Enhancing resource efficiency in terms of budgeting and administration by reducing duplication and allowing decision makers to implement adaptation when \u2018windows of opportunity\u2019 arise because adaptation objectives have already been embedded in strategies and plans Avoiding maladaptation since \u2018departments and agencies are better positioned to consider how actions within their own portfolio might affect climate resilience in other policy domains and segments of society\u2019 (Cuevas et al. 2016; Henstra 2022, pp. 3\u20134) However, mainstreaming is not without risks. For example, the absence of a dedicated framework or institution accountable for adaptation could translate into an absence of dedicated funding or clear legal mandate to implement adaptation, increasing the risk of policy dilution (Russel 2019; Braunschweiger and Putz 2021). Similarly, mainstreaming can lead to adaptation becoming a superficial box-checking exercise where it is deprioritized when competing with other sectoral objectives for resources. A range of strategies exist to embed adaptation across different levels or domains of governance. Literature arranges these strategies into a six-tier typology (table 2.1).

In addition to there being a range of strategies for mainstreaming, to which adaptation mainstreaming integrates adaptation considerations into the degree an institution\u2019s established functions, policies and practices varies widely (Bleby and Foerster 2023; Gim and Shin 2023). Literature identifies three levels of mainstreaming \u2013 coordination, harmonization and prioritization \u2013 that are defined by the extent to which adaptation is prioritized relative to the institution\u2019s pre-existing policy goals (table 2.2). Table 2.2 Levels of mainstreaming, their associated degree of integration and key features Level of mainstreaming Degree of integration Key features Coordination Weak Harmonization Medium Prioritization Strong Adaptation is recognized as a policy goal, but is secondary to existing priorities. This degree of integration would lead to its ad hoc inclusion in project design mainly to avoid conflicts with established policies. Adaptation is placed on equal terms with pre-existing policy goals. This degree of integration would lead to the systematic screening of strategies and planned activities to identify opportunities to advance adaptation objectives. Adaptation takes precedence over existing policy goals. This degree of integration would require a redesign of policies and decision-making processes through an adaptation-focused lens.

As is common in adaptation more broadly, the literature reports on outputs much more than outcomes and impacts of mainstreaming efforts (Runhaar et al. 2018; Pieterse, Du Toit and Van Niekerk 2021; Kim and Shin 2024). In other words, it is easier to measure whether adaptation is a stated objective in a sectoral plan, for example, than whether that sectoral plan which included an adaptation objective led to the reduction of climate risk. reviewed to assess the extent to which adaptation has been mainstreamed into these flagship development policies.9 The analysis assesses whether adaptation is absent from, acknowledged in or integrated in the contextual, strategic and operational sections of the documents with the aim of understanding if the impacts of climate change were recognized as a core development challenge for the country, if adaptation was viewed a strategic driver of development, and if this was reflected in the concrete implementation activities and accountability frameworks for turning strategy into action. Details of the methodology are presented in annex 2.C. 2.3.1 Assessing mainstreaming in the national development plans and strategies of small island developing States Integrating adaptation into national development plans or strategies is one example of a regulatory strategy for mainstreaming. By embedding climate risks and adaptation needs into its core economic and social planning, a country acknowledges \u2013 and commits to act on \u2013 the reality that its future prosperity depends on managing climate risks. For many developing countries, core economic and social planning processes are directed through national development plans and strategies (OECD 2012; Chimhowu, Hulme and Munro 2019). Recognizing the acute vulnerability of SIDS to climate impacts, the national development plans and strategies for 34 of the 39 sovereign SIDS were Given the different time-horizons, structures, formats and levels of detail for each plan or strategy, opportunities for mainstreaming adaptation similarly differ. Nonetheless, the analysis shows that all SIDS have integrated adaptation into at least one of contextual, strategic or operational sections of their plans. Almost all SIDS (94 per cent) have integrated adaptation into the strategic element of their plans and strategies, such as the vision, guiding principles, goals, cross-cutting issues and high-level objectives that set overall direction (figure 2.3). Cases of adaptation being absent or merely acknowledged tended to be in the contextual or operational parts of a national development plan, and occurred when the overall document itself was relatively short (i.e. less than 40 pages)",

Adaptation considerations were often concentrated in the environment, climate change and/ or disaster risk reduction sections of the plans. However, most SIDS refer to adaptation issues or actions in other sectors or thematic areas \u2013 most often in infrastructure, housing, health, and productive sectors like agriculture and forestr y; some went beyond these traditionally adaptation-relevant sectors to include areas such as information communication technologies, micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, and children and youth, demonstrating an understanding that adaptation is relevant to many aspects of national prosperity (box 2.2). While this initial review of SIDS is high-level and not representative of global progress, its results point to a promising trajector y towards embedding adaptation in development planning \u2013 a positive signal that can accelerate climate action both nationally and globally (see box 2.3). This analysis can provide a starting point for a broader analysis of mainstreaming that covers all countries, revealing whether adaptation is shaping mandates, budgets and decisions, and thus offering a credible way to assess progress in adaptation planning.

At the time of writing, the NDP 2025\u20132029 has only recently come into effect, therefore the potential to observe any outcomes of integrating adaptation into this instrument is limited. The integration of adaptation in previous NDPs, however, established adaptation and resilience as a priority for the Government, making it a priority for all ministries and other national and subnational government entities. The added urgency of establishing adaptation as a national priority is viewed as being critical in enabling recent progress made by ministries and subnational government in developing adaptation policies,10 mainstreaming adaptation into existing policies, strategies and regulations,11 and increasing or ringfencing budget allocations for adaptation interventions. A full case study providing insights into how adaptation was integrated into Fiji\u2019s NDP 2025\u20132029, the factors that enabled this to happen, the outcomes achieved through this process and lessons learned is found in annex 2.D. 10 For example, the development of the Health Adaptation Plan. 11 For example, the integration of climate-smart agriculture into the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways strategic development, or the updating of Fiji\u2019s building codes to include consideration of future climate risks. 15 Chapter 2 \u2013 Global progress on adaptation planning 2.3.2 Tracking global progress in adaptation mainstreaming through BTRs To compliment the targeted analysis presented above, this chapter also evaluates how BTRs can be leveraged to track progress in mainstreaming adaptation into policy processes across different levels and sectors.

At the cut-off date, 105 countries have submitted a BTR, 94 of which contained detailed information on climate impacts and adpatation.12 The analysis assessed whether countries reported on the mainstreaming of adaptation into policies across different levels of governance, and on initiatives implemented to catalyse mainstreaming.13 The methodology underlying this analysis is presented in annex 2.E.

Figure 2.4 (panel A) illustrates that reporting on mainstreaming into sectoral policies at the national level was by far most common, with 54 per cent of all countries doing this at least once. While no sector stood out as being widely reported, disaggregating by IPCC sectors indicates that countries were more likely to mainstream adaptation into policies related to agriculture and other ecosystem products, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, and cities and infrastructure than for other sectors (figure 2.4, panel B). Mainstreaming into national development policies, subnational policies and initiatives to facilitate adaptation mainstreaming were poorly reported on, scoring between 9 and 22 per cent. Mainstreaming into national development policies was the second-highest scoring indicator, while mainstreaming into subnational policies and the establishment of legal mandates for mainstreaming were the lowest scoring. Taking these results at face value suggests that while progress is being made at the sectoral level, countries are not meaningfully engaging in mainstreaming adaptation across all levels of governance, as advocated by the UAE FGCR and UNFCCC\u2019s NAP process. Similarly, it suggests that there are no clear differences in progress being made by developed and developing countries, with developed countries performing marginally better for some indicators and developing countries for others (figure 2.4, panel A). As BTRs constitute a secondary data source however, the results of this analysis is strongly influenced by the extent to which BTRs capture the full extent of countries\u2019 adaptation mainstreaming efforts. In reality, reporting on adaptation mainstreaming is relatively ad hoc in BTRs, with countries not systematically providing information about whether adaptation has been integrated into key policies across sectors and levels of governance. For example, of the 54 per cent of countries that report on adaptation mainstreaming into sectoral policies, 47 per cent of these only cover two or fewer IPCC sectors, and most do not provide information on progress \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 across other sectors.

In light of the identified information gaps, BTRs \u2013 while offering some insights \u2013 currently fall short as a reliable data source for tracking global progress in mainstreaming adaptation across all relevant strategies and plans. Thus, the results illustrated in figure 2.4 are likely to underestimate the progress being made by countries. To enable processes such as the global stocktake to accurately track progress against the mainstreaming element of the UAE FGCR\u2019s planning target, reporting on adaptation mainstreaming needs to improve significantly in the next iteration of BTRs. To support improved and comparable reporting on adaptation mainstreaming, countries require clear and detailed guidance on how to track and report efforts across all levels of government. 2.4 What factors are inhibiting further progress in national adaptation planning and adaptation mainstreaming? The above analyses of national adaptation planning and adaptation mainstreaming point to notable progress towards the UAE FGCR\u2019s target on adaptation planning. Despite shortcomings, the fact that the vast majority of countries now have a national adaptation planning instrument in place should be viewed positively. Likewise, while not being globally representative, the fact that most SIDS have integrated adaptation into their national development plans and strategies indicates that countries are taking steps to mainstream adaptation into relevant plans and strategies, even if this trend is not reflected in national reporting within BTRs. However, the analyses presented in this chapter also point to important gaps. This is most clearly illustrated by the 25 countries that are still without a national adaptation plan, strategy or policy, and the 36 countries that possess a plan, strategy or policy that is either over 10 years old or has exceeded its period of validation. Similarly, the fact that a minority of SIDS have not integrated adaptation across all elements of their flagship development policies \u2013 despite being acutely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change \u2013 illustrates that there is still progress to be made. Identifying how to address these gaps requires understanding the barriers to national adaptation planning and adaptation mainstreaming that are being experienced by countries. This chapter has not conducted a primary analysis of barriers to these processes; however, available literature indicates that countries are encountering a similar set of barriers to both processes. These can be summarized as: \u25b6 institutional frameworks. Underdeveloped Fragmented governance of adaptation and weak coordination between government actors impede both national adaptation planning and the mainstreaming of adaptation into relevant policies, causing delays and reducing the effectiveness of these processes (Clar 2019; Biesbroek 2021; UNFCCC LEG 2021; Lee, Paavola and Dessai 2023; Lewis 2024; OECD 2024a; Qi and Beauchamp 2025). Meanwhile, where clear legal mandate for adaptation is absent, government actors can perceive they do not possess the authority to engage in these processes (Kehler and Birchall",

Meanwhile, where clear legal mandate for adaptation is absent, government actors can perceive they do not possess the authority to engage in these processes (Kehler and Birchall 2023; Rogers, Adams and Byrne 2023; Rogers, Adams and Byrne 2024). 17 Chapter 2 \u2013 Global progress on adaptation planning \u25b6 \u25b6 information to guide decision- Inadequate making. To ensure that adaptation planning and mainstreaming processes are effective, policymakers require robust climate risk data generated by systemic observation systems and climate risk assessments, and information about how successful the previous planning instruments were in achieving adaptation objectives generated through monitoring, evaluation and learning systems. However, many countries \u2013 particularly SIDS and LDCs \u2013 do not have systems in place that are able to generate this information (Leiter 2021; OECD 2024b; World Meteorological Organization 2024). Where this information is not available or of low quality, policymakers will find it difficult to develop and revise planning instruments in ways that reflect emerging insights into climate risks and integrate lessons learned from previous policy cycles (Dany and Lebel 2020; Ford et al. 2021; Garfin et al. 2021; OECD 2024b; NAP Global Network 2025). Human and financial resource constraints. Insufficient financial and human resources can represent a barrier for all countries, regardless of their level of development and economic capacity (Lee, Paavola and Dessai 2023; Mix et al. 2024). However, these constraints disproportionately affect developing countries, in particular LDCs and SIDS (UNFCCC LEG 2021; Robinson et al. 2022; UNFCCC LEG 2025). For example, cash flow issues can prevent important activities (e.g. workshops, trainings, stakeholder engagement processes) from happening and therefore causing national adaptation planning and adaptation mainstreaming processes to stall (Independent Evaluation Unit [IEU] 2023). Insufficient human resources can have a similar effect. These effects are often exacerbated by frequent staff turnover in government departments, which disrupts continuity as new staff require training and leads to losses in institutional memory (Lee, Paavola and Dessai 2023; Sorgho et al. 2023; IEU 2023). \u25b6 The low prioritization of adaptation as a political priority. Operational realities such as short electoral cycles, short planning cycles, frequent political turnover, low public interest and a lack of influential champions within government can undermine governments\u2019 ability to prioritize adaptation (Lee, Paavola and Dessai 2022; Kehler and Birchall 2023; Rogers, Adams and Byrne 2023; OECD 2024a). As a result, government actors may find it difficult to sustain momentum for national adaptation planning and adaptation mainstreaming processes over longer periods of time, leading to delays in the policy process as other priorities become the focus of available resources. Beyond the above factors, literature",

As a result, government actors may find it difficult to sustain momentum for national adaptation planning and adaptation mainstreaming processes over longer periods of time, leading to delays in the policy process as other priorities become the focus of available resources. Beyond the above factors, literature also points to difficulties experienced by developing countries in securing international finance to support the preparation of national adaptation planning instruments and implementation of interventions to address the capacity gaps identified above (e.g. strengthening institutional frameworks and building human capacity within relevant government actors [IEU 2023]). LDCs and SIDS have particularly struggled with climate funds\u2019 burdensome funding application processes, leading to some countries experiencing significant delays in accessing funding (UNFCCC LEG 2021; IEU 2022; IEU 2023; OECD 2023; Qi and Beauchamp 2025; UNFCCC LEG 2025). Once applications are approved, further delays in activities can be caused by slow disbursement of finance by the climate funds (IEU 2023). The barriers identified by literature point to a series of broad areas for action and emphasize the continued need for increased finance and capacity-building to support national adaptation planning and adaptation mainstreaming processes, and investments in impact, vulnerability and risk assessments, MEL systems, and institutional development. It also highlights the need to accelerate access to financial support for adaptation planning by removing administrative bottlenecks and strengthening countries\u2019 long-term capacity to prepare and submit funding proposals. 18 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty In the Philippines, Jesus Seno Cortes has been working in urban agricultural farming since losing his work as a motorized tricycle driver during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The five-year moving average across this period has increased by 86 per cent to US$494 million/year, with the total combined funding volume reaching almost US$920 million in 2024. While this data could indicate a new and positive trend, following a stagnation in funding for new adaptation projects since 2018, it is too early to draw a conclusion about implications for longer-term trends. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) are a significant provider of multilateral funding for adaptation, accounting for a total of 57 per cent of international public adaptation finance flows to developing countries. Compared to the Adaptation Fund, GCF, LDCF and SCCF, MDBs employ a different mix of financial instruments which in turn leads to differences in sectoral focus and scale in implementation. In particular, it leads to a greater focus on infrastructure. Currently, the available data on MDB-funded adaptation projects lack detail, which hinders in-depth analysis of MDBs\u2019 contribution to adaptation implementation and results globally. As at 31 August 2025, 94 countries have submitted a biennial transparency report (BTR) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) containing detailed information on climate impacts and adaptation. While this volume of BTRs is promising, a number of gaps exist that undermine their ability to adequately inform global assessments of adaptation: \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf The coverage provided by the BTRs submitted is unequal across different country classifications and regions, with least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS) and African countries particularly underrepresented. Information on adaptation action and the results of adaptation accounts for a small proportion of all information included in BTRs (just over 20 per cent). The majority of the information in these documents relates to climate hazards, systems at risk, climate impacts and adaptation priorities. Compared to the other thematic targets of the United Arab Emirates Framework for Global Climate Resilience (UAE FGCR), there is relatively little information related to the thematic targets of health, poverty alleviation and livelihoods, and cultural heritage. The consistency of adaptation reporting within BTRs needs to improve to enable comprehensive assessments of progress towards the UAE FGCR targets. Most countries do not consistently link information on climate hazards, climate impacts and risks with information on adaptation priorities, actions and results. In addition, when reporting on progress in implementation and results, many countries do not provide information about progress made in implementing priorities set out in key planning instruments",

Most countries do not consistently link information on climate hazards, climate impacts and risks with information on adaptation priorities, actions and results. In addition, when reporting on progress in implementation and results, many countries do not provide information about progress made in implementing priorities set out in key planning instruments such as national adaptation plans (NAPs) and the adaptation components of nationally determined contributions (NDCs). This information forms the basis of the UAE FGCR\u2019s target on implementation and is therefore required to assess progress towards this target. 22 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty 3.1 Introduction implementation and While planning and financing are important to enable adaptation, to understand its effectiveness, assessments of adaptation actions that have been undertaken or completed are needed. This year, this chapter assesses the status of global implementation efforts using two types of publicly available global data sources: data on adaptation projects implemented with financial support from MDBs and the four funds that serve the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, and BTRs, in which countries describe their adaptation efforts, which includes providing information about their implementation and results. The first round of BTRs were due by the end of 2024; these have provided an opportunity to assess countries\u2019 current implementation progress on adaptation and the quality of their adaptation reporting. The analysis provides practical insights for improving adaptation reporting in the next round of BTRs. These are due by the end of 2026 and will be an important input for the second global stocktake. The analysis also assesses to what extent current reporting on adaptation enables an assessment of progress towards the UAE FGCR, and how global adaptation indicators considered under the UAE-Bel\u00e9m work programme could enhance global adaptation assessments. Understanding global progress on adaptation implementation requires combining multiple data sources (Garschagen et al. 2022). Each year, therefore, this chapter on implementation analyses various data sources with global coverage, as they become available \u2013 like the BTRs this year (see annex 3.A). While the stocktake of adaptation projects under the Adaptation Fund, GCF, and the two funds managed by the GEF (the LDCF and SCCF), is updated annually, other sources are reviewed less often (see table 3.A.1 in annex 3.A). This chapter only includes actions that are already under implementation or have been completed. It therefore does not include actions that have only been proposed or approved. The term \u2018actions\u2019 is used as an umbrella term to cover any type of implementation. Annex 3 gives details about the methodologies and data sources used. 3.2 Implemented adaptation under international funding 3.2.1 Implemented adaptation projects funded by the Adaptation Fund, the Green Climate Fund, and the two funds managed by the GEF (the LDCF and SCCF)",

However, data from 2024 and 2025 show a large spike in 2024, with grants for new adaptation projects under the four funds reaching a total value of almost US$920 million, compared to a moving average of US$494 million/year between 2019 and 2023 (figure 3.1). There are indications that this trend has continued into 2025, though data for the year is still incomplete. While this data could indicate a new and positive trend in the scale of implementation under these funds, it is too early to draw a conclusion about implications for longer-term trends. Indeed, the overall trend in international public climate finance commitments (figure 4.4) does not indicate or explain any abrupt increases in adaptation project finance. At the same time the trend towards larger funding volumes per project (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2023; UNEP 2024a) has continued, with projects attracting over US$10 million in grants accounting for 36 per cent of all new adaptation projects beginning implementation since 2017, while 16 per cent of all projects beginning over this period had a grant-value of over US$25 million. For comparison, in 2017, implementation began for almost the same number of adaptation projects as in 2024, but the combined funding value was less than half the total for 2024 (figure 3.1). Despite this positive trend, neither the number nor the size of new adaptation projects, nor the total amount of funding provided through the four funds is adequate given the observed acceleration in climate impacts. 1 Note that the GCF and the SCCF also fund cross-cutting projects that jointly address mitigation and adaptation.

Infrastructure (transport, energy and other social infrastructure) has been the dominant sector in terms of implementation funding, receiving an average of 26 per cent of disbursed MDB adaptation finance over the five-year period 2019\u20132023. It is followed by agriculture, forestry and fishing, with an average of 17 per cent, and water supply and sanitation, with an average of 14 per cent (see figure 3.2). This sectoral distribution has remained relatively stable since 2019. The share of implementation funded by MDBs in the agriculture and water sectors is in line with the implementation focus of projects under the Adaptation Fund, GCF, and the two funds managed by the GEF (the LDCF and SCCF), and it reflects the adaptation finance priorities expressed by developing countries (see figure 5.3 in UNEP 2021a and section 4.2.2 in this report). However, while infrastructure receives the greatest share of implementation finance from MDBs, it accounts for less than 5 per cent of all implemented projects under the Adaptation Fund, GCF, LDCF and SCCF (see figure 5.3 in UNEP 2021a). This contrast shows that different types of adaptation actions are being funded by MDBs and by the UNFCCC financial mechanism, 2 and through a different mix of financial instruments. More than half (57 per cent) of MDBs\u2019 adaptation commitments are provided through debt instruments, whereas the UNFCCC financial mechanism has so far been predominantly grant-based, albeit typically with project funding sizes of less than US$10 million under the Adaptation Fund, LDCF and SCCF. Accordingly, implementation under the UNFCCC financial mechanism has focused more on capacity-building and on interventions on a smaller scale, although this is changing thanks to the larger funding volumes provided by the GCF,",

Accordingly, implementation under the UNFCCC financial mechanism has focused more on capacity-building and on interventions on a smaller scale, although this is changing thanks to the larger funding volumes provided by the GCF, which also increasingly uses other financial instruments (see section 3.2.1). 2 The UNFCCC financial mechanism comprises the funds that officially serve the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, namely the Adaptation Fund, GCF, and the two funds managed by the GEF (the LDCF and SCCF). 24 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty Figure 3.2 Implemented adaptation funded by MDBs, by sector in the period 2019\u20132023 Other 10% Water suppply and sanitation 14% Multisectoral 8% Government and civil society 6% Disaster response and relief 11% Infrastructure (transport, energy and other social infrastructure) 26% To track adaptation finance, MDBs have adopted a joint methodology under which activities have to demonstrate a link to climate risks and projects have to state an explicit intent to reduce vulnerability (European Investment Bank 2022, pp. 58\u201364). This methodology differentiates among adaptation activities, categorizing them as climate- proofing (i.e. enabling the achievement of intended results despite anticipated climate risks), directly reducing climate risks, or reducing the underlying causes of vulnerability (see annex 3.B). However, MDBs do not disclose how their adaptation finance is distributed among these three categories, and empirical research shows that projects\u2019 intended effects on vulnerability often do not materialize or are not sustainable (Eriksen et al. 2021; Mills-Novoa 2023; see also the lessons from evaluations of adaptation projects in chapter 3 of UNEP 2024a). This lack of transparency on the proportional financing of different types of adaptation action, and very limited access to detailed information about the projects supported (project titles and documents, amount and type of financing, results) currently prevents deeper analysis of MDBs\u2019 contribution to adaptation implementation globally. Ideally, going forward, MDBs would allow third-party access to project-level data, enabling independent analysis and verification of the data currently provided at aggregate level in the annual Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks\u2019 Climate Finance (for the 2024 summary report, see African Development Bank et al. 2025).

Currently, no aggregated reporting on adaptation results from MDBs is available. 3.3 Assessing adaptation in biennial transparency reports Under the Paris Agreement, countries \u201cshould provide information related to climate change impacts and adaptation\u201d every two years via BTRs (article 13.8).3 While it is not mandatory, the information \u201cshould\u201d be provided \u201cin accordance with\u201d a list of topics that cover the whole of the adaptation cycle, including climate risks, planning, implementation and results of adaptation (see figure 1.1, chapter 1). Moreover, it should follow the structure agreed in the modalities, procedures and guidelines for the transparency framework for action and support referred to in article 13 of the Paris Agreement (see annex 3.C, box 3.C.1). Since all countries are obligated to submit BTRs, and should prepare them using the standardized list of topics provided by the modalities, procedures and guidelines, these reports are a key data source for assessing global progress on adaptation. 3 Adaptation reporting under the Paris Agreement is explained in annex 3.C. 25 Chapter 3 \u2013 Global progress on adaptation implementation Section 3.3 presents an assessment of BTRs submitted by 31 August 2025.4 The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate the quality of reporting within BTRs, identify what these documents tell us about adaptation efforts and implementation and highlight areas where future BTRs should be strengthened. This analysis is informed by a systematic data-gathering exercise, the methodology for which is found in annex 3.C. 3.3.1 Coverage and level of detail of adaptation reporting As at 31 August 2025, 105 countries had submitted a BTR, of which 94 include details on adaptation (see figure 3.3, panel A and annex 3.C).5 The proportion of countries reporting on adaptation through BTRs far surpasses those previously reporting on adaptation via adaptation communications, which are currently only available for 35 countries as stand- alone documents (see UNEP 2023, chapter 3). The fact that the first round of BTRs has much greater coverage across countries means they represent a unique opportunity to analyse countries\u2019 adaptation efforts comprehensively and across regions. However, the BTRs provide uneven coverage across country classifications and United Nations regional groupings. For example, while 58 of the 94 BTRs have been submitted by developing countries, this only represents 37 per cent of all developing countries (figure 3.3, panel B).6 Developed countries are much better represented, with 86 per cent having submitted a BTR containing detailed information on climate impacts and adaptation (36 countries).

Within the developing countries bracket, only eight SIDS (21 per cent) and six LDCs (14 per cent) have submitted BTRs with detailed information on climate impacts and adaptation, which could indicate that preparing national reports such as BTRs is most burdensome for the countries with the least capacity. The proportion of countries that have submitted BTRs also differs across United Nations regions, with Western Europe and Other States having the highest coverage (85 per cent) and African States the lowest (32 per cent; see figure 3.3, panel A). Imbalances in BTR submission across different country classifications and regions will lead to biases in the data that can be extracted from BTRs and thus needs to be considered when assessing adaptation progress. In the short-term, these imbalances emphasize the need for global assessments of adaptation \u2013 for example under the global stocktake \u2013 to use a diverse range of data sources. In the longer-term, to enable the BTRs to serve as a representative global evidence base, enhanced financial and capacity-building support for adaptation reporting should be made available to LDCs, SIDS and African countries. 4 The deadline for BTR submission was 31 December 2024. However, due to a significant number of countries submitting BTRs after this deadline, the cut-off date applied in this analysis was extended to 31 August 2025. 5 As at 31 August 2025, 106 Parties to the Paris Agreement had submitted a BTR to the UNFCCC. Although a party to the Paris Agreement, the European Union has been removed from this analysis as it is not a nation State. 6 In this analysis, the term \u2018developed countries\u2019 refers to country Parties to the UNFCCC included on the list of Annex I countries in the Kyoto Protocol. The term \u2018developing countries\u2019 refers to all other country Parties to the UNFCCC that are not included on that list. 26 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty Figure 3.3: Panel A Global distribution of countries that have submitted a BTR with detailed information on climate impacts and adaptation as at 31 August 2025, and the number of data points per country.

While many countries have aligned their BTRs with the structure of the modalities, procedures and guidelines (see annex 3.C, box 3.C.1), there are notable differences in the level of detail of BTRs across countries and regions.7 The level of detail in the BTRs submitted ranges from fewer than 100 to more than 300 data points8 across key topics, with only a few countries having substantially higher levels of detail (more than 300 data points related to adaptation). Information on implementation and results is key to assessing progress, but countries are disproportionately reporting on climate hazards, systems at risk, climate change impacts and adaptation priorities. These account for 70 per cent of the data points, while data points related to actions and results account for just 14 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively (figure 3.4). This lack of data on actions and results hinders the assessment of progress. It also highlights where reporting in the second round of BTRs, due in 2026, needs to be strengthened. Figure 3.4 Overview of the distribution of data points related to adaptation topics across all 94 BTRs containing detailed information on climate impacts and adaptation Results 7% MEL 2% Hazards 16% Actions 14% Barriers 6% Adaptation priorities 22% Systems at risk 14% Climate impacts 19% BTRs also constitute an important source of information for assessing progress towards the targets under the UAE FGCR.9 Among the 94 BTRs with information on adaptation, the quantity of information on each",

Health, and poverty alleviation and livelihoods, have a markedly lower level of reporting, while information related to cultural heritage is almost entirely absent (see figure 3.5, panel A). The low level of data related to cultural heritage may reflect the fact that it has only recently emerged as a prominent theme within adaptation (Sesana et al. 2021). Similarly, low levels of data related to poverty alleviation and livelihoods may be due to it being a cross-cutting theme that often features implicitly within the sectoral themes of agriculture, water and ecosystems. Notable differences also exist across different country classifications (figure 3.5, panel B). For example, food and agriculture is a prominent theme in developing countries (representing 20 per cent of all data points), particularly SIDS and LDCs (24 and 27 per cent respectively) but less so in developed countries (10 per cent of all data points). Similarly, data related to biodiversity and ecosystems features prominently in all countr y classifications except the LDCs. 7 The level of detail is expressed by the number of adaptation-relevant data points that were extracted from each BTR based on the data extraction protocol (see annex 3.C). 8 A data point refers to a segment of text (such as a statement or block of text) in a BTR that contains information on any of the topics relevant for assessing climate impacts and adaptation. During data extraction, these text segments were copied into an Excel database, where they were tagged and analysed in line with the protocol described in annex 3.C. 9 As confirmed in Decision 2/CMA.5, para 15 (UNFCCC 2024) and in Decision 3/CMA.6, para 34 (UNFCCC 2025). 28 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty The distribution of themes is likely to reflect the relative importance of certain sectors across country classifications and regions.

Of the 94 BTRs with information on adaptation, 68 BTRs (72 per cent) include detailed information on adaptation actions. The remaining BTRs offer general descriptions, for example, listing projects or programmes without providing sufficient detail on the type and extent of actions. In other cases, countries note that their adaptation actions are set out in other documents (for example, NAPs, national adaptation strategies or national communications). Developed and developing countries that are neither LDCs nor SIDS typically provide more data about adaptation actions (20.9 and 15.4 data points per BTR respectively) than their LDC and SIDS counterparts (7.5 and 8.1 respectively; see figure 3.3, panel C). In total, 1,640 adaptation actions were identified in 68 BTRs. Unlike in NAP progress reports, where countries assess the implementation status of NAP actions (UNEP 2024a, chapter 3), information on each action\u2019s stage of implementation is often not provided in BTRs.

Mapping the 1,640 adaptation actions against the thematic targets of the UAE FGCR reveals a distribution similar to that found for all information reported in the BTRs (figure 3.4) There are a relatively large number of actions reported in areas such as biodiversity and ecosystems (23 per cent), infrastructure and human settlements (18 per cent), water and sanitation (16 per cent), and food and agriculture (14 per cent). In contrast, actions targeting health and poverty alleviation and livelihoods are reported far less frequently (each accounting for 5 per cent), while those addressing cultural heritage are nearly absent, accounting for less than 1 per cent of all actions reported.10 The adaptation actions reported were analysed using a typology developed by Berrang-Ford et al. (2021). This analysis shows that almost half of the actions reported in BTRs are institutional in nature, with government policies, programmes and research being particularly prominent (48 per cent). The second category is natural resource-based approaches (25 per cent), within which water management is especially prominent. The third biggest category of actions relate to efforts to reduce climate risk by adjusting behaviour/organizational cultures (22 per cent). Finally, structural/technological actions are the least reported category in the BTRs (5 per cent). This distribution of adaptation actions across these action types contrasts with evidence of implementation reported in peer-reviewed literature, which highlights a dominance of behavioural and structural/technological actions (Berrang-Ford et al. 2021). The difference may stem from national repor ts emphasizing government- endorsed actions, while peer-reviewed studies often document local initiatives by communities, households and individuals. This demonstrates that BTRs are unlikely to capture the whole range of adaptation action under way in a country. It suggests, moreover, that global assessments of progress in adaptation implementation should draw upon additional 3.3.3 Adaptation results reported in biennial transparency reports Just half of the countries that provide details on adaptation in their BTRs also report information on the results of their adaptation efforts. Nearly three-quarters of reported results are outputs (the immediate products of interventions), while outcomes (intermediate changes) and impacts (ultimate or long-term effects) account for 16 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively (see figure 3.6). The majority of countries describe the results of adaptation initiatives, e.g. of concrete projects or programmes. This information is typically generated by the monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) systems of the adaptation initiatives being reported on or by monitoring undertaken by subnational authorities (see Cran 2023; UNEP 2024a), and not national- level adaptation MEL systems \u2013 except where subnational MEL systems feed into the national MEL system (Leiter 2015).

This explains why the number of countries able to provide information on results (48) was greater than the number of countries reporting the existence of national adaptation MEL systems (36) (see section 3.3.4). Beyond reporting on the results of adaptation initiatives, some countries also report implementation progress relative to targets, baselines or completion levels (e.g. Algeria, Chile and Nepal), while others refer to progress made towards priorities set out in their NDCs (e.g. Kenya). More consistent reporting on progress towards implementing NAPs, NDCs and other national adaptation planning instruments, or progress towards achieving targets contained within these instruments would support a more systematic assessment of the implementation of adaptation plans and priorities (Dale and Bakhtiari 2025) and provide a better basis for assessing progress towards the UAE FGCR implementation target.11 10 In total, 19 per cent of the 1,640 actions reported on were not specific to a thematic target. In most cases, these actions were cross-cutting. For example, developing a NAP or conducting national impact, vulnerability and risk assessments. 11 The UAE FGCR\u2019s target on implementation states that \u201cby 2030 all Parties have progressed in implementing their national adaptation plans, policies and strategies and, as a result, have reduced the social and economic impacts of the key climate hazards identified in the assessments referred to in paragraph 10(a) above\u201d (Decision 2/CMA.5 [UNFCCC 2024, p. 24]). 30 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty Figure 3.6 Frequency and types of adaptation results reported in BTRs Type of results reported Adaptation covered Details on actions included Information on results provided Definition The immediate products of actions 94 BTRs 68 BTRs 48 BTRs Outputs 72% Example Adoption of adaptation plans, integration of adaptation into sectoral, national, and subnational strategies, completion of risk assessments, training and awareness raising, distribution and promotion of adaptive technologies and practices, establishment of climate information systems Definition The short-term and medium-term effects of an intervention\u2019s outputs Outcomes 16% Example Uptake of adaptation-relevant technologies and practices, improved access to basic services, expansion of reforested areas Impacts 12% Definition The ultimate effects or longer-term changes resulting from the intervention Example Changes in the state of ecosystems and natural resources as a result of restoration and ecosystem protection efforts, sufficiency of water availability, improved agricultural production, and enhanced resilience Source: Definitions adapted from OECD (2023) To assess whether adaptation actions are reducing vulnerability and enhancing adaptive capacities and climate resilience, information on results beyond immediate outputs is needed (see definitions in figure 3.6).

Assessments of adaptation outcomes face various challenges, which are compounded at the national and global level (UNEP 2017; Leiter and Pringle 2018; Garschagen et al. 2022; Singh et al. 2022; Goodwin and Olazabal 2025). Just five countries have assessed how well their NAPs enable responses to observed and projected climate risks, and all five concluded that \u201cNAP implementation is inadequate and ineffective relative to the extent of climatic risks\u201d (UNEP 2024a, p. 35). The difficulties of assessing adaptation outcomes therefore constitute the first hurdle to increased results reporting. The second hurdle is limited capacities and resources to develop and implement adaptation MEL systems. While many BTRs report on how adaptation processes take into account gender and social inclusion (GESI) (box 3.1), only 4 per cent of the results reported through BTRs are directly related to GESI, and they come from just seven countries. GESI-related results include statements on the inclusion of gender and intersectional approaches in vulnerability and risk assessment and planning (Chile, Nepal), disaggregating data on the reach and beneficiaries of interventions by gender (Kenya, Nepal, Peru), empowering women by supporting their uptake of adaptive practices and participation in decision-making (Ghana) and promoting gender-responsive budgeting across all ministries (Nepal). It is also essential to recognize the challenges and constraints that impede the translation of adaptation priorities into actions, as well as the gaps between actions and their intended results. Countries highlight a wide range of barriers across the adaptation cycle that constrain their ability to plan, implement and assess adaptation. Informational, financial and institutional barriers are the challenges most frequently cited, in line with findings from NAP progress reports, adaptation communications and literature reviews (UNEP 2023, chapter 3; UNEP 2024a). These barriers are often interconnected, as financial constraints limit investments in capacity development and institutional strengthening, thereby reinforcing challenges across the adaptation cycle. Countries should strive to provide detailed information in their BTRs about contextual linkages between adaptation barriers and how barriers 31 Chapter 3 \u2013 Global progress on adaptation implementation have been overcome (Eisenack et al. 2014; Lee, Paavola and Dessai 2022; Dale and Bakhtiari 2025). 3.3.4 Information on the monitoring, evaluation and learning system Out of the 94 countries with information on adaptation in their BTRs, 36 report on MEL systems that aim to track the implementation of adaptation actions.

They explain, for instance, how the MEL system functions, how data is gathered and shared, and how domestic reporting is done. In some of the 36 countries, the national adaptation MEL system is still under development. Given that a global stocktake of NAP MEL systems in 2021 found that more than 50 countries were in the process of developing a national adaptation MEL system and 22 countries had active reporting on NAP implementation (Leiter 2021), the coverage on adaptation MEL systems in BTRs is lower than expected. In line with the UAE FGCR target under which every country commits to establishing and operationalizing a MEL system for their national adaptation efforts (Decision 2/CMA.5, para. 10d [UNFCCC 2024]), the second round of BTRs needs to provide more information on efforts to develop and undertake MEL of adaptation actions and results. It is noteworthy that only 12 countries list adaptation indicators in their BTRs. This contrasts with the 48 countries that provide information on results (see figure 3.8) and with the 43 countries whose NAPs include indicators (NAP Global Network 2025). The gap can be partly explained by countries referring to their domestic NAP implementation reports, which were analysed in the 2024 Adaptation Gap Report, rather than restating all available details in their BTR. In other cases, countries with indicators in their NAPs have not yet operationalized a MEL system that enables data gathering and reporting. To support a coherent assessment of progress towards the second global stocktake, countries need to increase transparency around how information on implementation and results is being generated. In total, 229 indicators were identified across these 12 BTRs. Concerningly, just over one-third have a clear and direct link to adaptation, while a further one-fifth have at least a potential link to it. Almost one-third of the 229 indicators have no connection to adaptation or their wording on the matter is unclear. This finding highlights the need for better quality adaptation MEL systems and for further capacity-building, as stipulated by a UAE FGCR target.12 Reporting on a global set of adaptation indicators, such as the list of 100 indicators proposed by a mandated expert group (Indicator Expert Group 2025a; Indicator Expert Group 2025b) requires countries to have operational MEL systems, including indicators. In the next round of BTRs, countries could provide more information on their adaptation MEL systems and the further efforts required to operationalize them. They could also reflect on the level of alignment between the indicators in use and indicators under the UAE FGCR and describe the support they need to report against global adaptation indicators.",

They could also reflect on the level of alignment between the indicators in use and indicators under the UAE FGCR and describe the support they need to report against global adaptation indicators. In future rounds of the global stocktake, the global list of indicators under the UAE FGCR will be crucial for establishing a common reference point for assessing adaptation results and progress. To ensure meaningful reporting, however, countries require targeted support to develop and strengthen MEL systems, including indicators, that can effectively feed data into the global indicators for the UAE FGCR. 3.3.5 Consistency of information within biennial transparency reports The quality of adaptation reporting is not only determined by the scope, relevance and detail of the information provided, but also by the extent to which it enables links to be consistently drawn between climate hazards, systems at risk, climate impacts, adaptation priorities, actions and their results (Nowak et al. 2024; Reckien et al. 2025). To assess consistency within BTRs, the coverage of systems at risk and climate impacts was compared to that of actions and results (see annex 3.C). The resulting consistency score shows how closely information provided about actions matches information provided about climate-related risks and climate impacts: values approaching 1 reflect strong alignment, while values closer to 0 indicate a mismatch, signalling inconsistency. A consistency score of zero means that the BTR lacks information to enable a comparison. This score was allocated to 29 countries, primarily because their BTRs contained insufficient information on actions and results to enable comparison. The consistency score of the remaining countries ranges between 0.151 and 0.914. On average, SIDS have the lowest average consistency scores (0.28) due to limited reporting on actions and results (see figure 3.3, panel C) while developed countries have the highest average consistency score (0.517). These scores imply that many countries need to increase the quality of their reporting by more clearly linking information provided on climate hazards, risks and impacts to adaptation actions and their results to enable an assessment of adequacy and effectiveness. Countries can establish this link in their reporting by ensuring that descriptions of actions include their adaptation rationale 12 The UAE FGCR target on monitoring, evaluation and learning states that \u201cby 2030 all Parties have designed, established and operationalized a system for monitoring, evaluation and learning for their national adaptation efforts and have built the required institutional capacity to fully implement the system\u201d (Decision 2/CMA.5, para 10d [UNFCCC 2024, p.24]). 32 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty and descriptions of outcomes and impacts clearly articulate their relevance to present and projected climate risks.",

For instance, while Egypt\u2019s BTR contains 57 data points, it still achieves a strong alignment across multiple sectors 33 Chapter 3 \u2013 Global progress on adaptation implementation by presenting information on both systems at risk and impacts alongside actions in the same sectors. This shows that consistency depends as much on the balanced coverage and structuring of information as on the sheer number of data points. Recent studies employing a similar methodology have found substantial gaps in consistency. Only 40 per cent and 9 per cent of African NAPs and NDCs, respectively, provide consistent links between climate risks, priorities, and implementation plans (Nowak et al. 2024). Seventy per cent of adaptation plans in European cities show inconsistency in at least one connection along the chain from hazards to results (Reckien et al. 2025). These findings are confirmed by the analysis of BTRs, which found an average consistency score of 0.44 across all countries, and 0.63 when excluding the 29 countries whose BTRs were missing information on actions and results. The analysis further shows that African countries with high consistency scores in NAPs and NDCs (based on Nowak et al. 2024) also tend to have high consistency scores in their BTRs, suggesting that improving consistency in reporting instruments should begin with strengthening planning instruments (see chapter 2). This would facilitate the integration of this information into BTRs. Box 3.1 GESI in BTRs Overall, reporting in BTRs demonstrates that countries\u2019 adaptation processes are increasingly mainstreaming GESI considerations, albeit with significant variation. Out of the 105 BTRs submitted by countries by 31 August 2025,13 over a quarter (30 countries) are gender-blind, i.e. they do not explicitly acknowledge gender when reporting climate impacts, adaptation priorities, actions implementation, and results. Of the 75 countries that mention gender in relation to adaptation, there is considerable variation in how gender is acknowledged and operationalized, with approaches ranging from gender-neutral to gender-sensitive (see figure 3.8). No country demonstrates a truly gender-transformative approach. This could either be because examples of gender- transformative actions may sit elsewhere institutionally (in the national legislature, in other ministries and departments) and are not reported in BTRs or because gender-transformative action around adaptation is not prioritized or even envisioned. Gender-sensitive approaches are the most common",

This could either be because examples of gender- transformative actions may sit elsewhere institutionally (in the national legislature, in other ministries and departments) and are not reported in BTRs or because gender-transformative action around adaptation is not prioritized or even envisioned. Gender-sensitive approaches are the most common (43 countries). They typically include mainstreaming approaches that implement actions to improve women\u2019s adaptive capacities; establish dedicated national gender equality policies/plans; enable inclusive adaptation (e.g. through supportive financing or women\u2019s leadership); and put in place gender-sensitive MEL systems to track gender and equity outcomes. Notably, the Lima Work Programme on Gender is cited by a number of BTRs categorized as gender- sensitive, highlighting the importance of dedicated training and awareness. Gender-targeted approaches (17 countries) involve actions such as collecting gender-disaggregated data or conducting sectoral impact assessments that examine gendered vulnerability. Gender-neutral approaches (15 countries) acknowledge gender in passing, typically in the introduction to the BTR, but do not discuss it meaningfully as an adaptation priority or mainstream it in planned and implemented adaptation actions. All BTRs include information on social inclusion, either through gender (as described in figure 3.8) and/or through a focus on Indigenous communities, youth and children, and/or marginalized and vulnerable social groups. The main way GESI is implemented through adaptation is through national policies and laws on inclusion, universal rights and the targeting of marginalized groups (see also Daz\u00e9 and Hunter 2022). In general, gender is equated with women and with common representations of women as vulnerable to or victims of climate change without explicit coverage of intersectional identities of all genders shaping climate vulnerability and capacity to act. Brazil and Chile are notable outliers, with detailed sections on how gender intersects with race and ethnicity, respectively. Over half of the 75 BTRs that mention gender acknowledge the importance of supporting and leveraging Indigenous and Local Knowledge (42 countries), and these tend to be countries that have large Indigenous populations and national priorities that mainstream Indigenous values (e.g. in Bolivia [Plurinational State of], Canada, Chile, Indonesia, New Zealand, South Africa and Vanuatu). The most common approach for mainstreaming is to use diverse knowledge systems in adaptation planning and implementation. 13 As information about GESI considerations and how they relate to climate impacts and adaptation was sometimes found outside the climate impact and adaptation chapter of the BTRs, the analysis presented in box 3.1 assessed all 105 BTRs submitted by 31 August 2025.

These gaps hinder the provision of crucial insights into current adaptation efforts by countries and limit the extent to which BTRs can adequately inform assessments of progress towards the targets outlined by the UAE FGCR. Based on these findings, the following recommendations for improving adaptation reporting within BTRs are made: Provide more information related to the UAE FGCR\u2019s thematic targets on health, poverty alleviation and livelihoods, and cultural heritage to improve understanding of progress being made in these thematic areas (3.3.1). \u25b6 Provide more information on adaptation actions and results, in particular on outcomes and impacts of adaptation. It is also important to demonstrate progress in implementing priorities set out in key planning instruments such as NAPs and NDCs (3.3.3). 35 Chapter 3 \u2013 Global progress on adaptation implementation \u25b6 \u25b6 \u25b6 \u25b6 Provide detailed information about barriers to adaptation planning and implementation, as well as information about effective strategies for overcoming these barriers (3.3.3). Enhance information on efforts to develop systems for MEL of adaptation actions and results (3.3.4). Improve links between information on climate hazards, risks and impacts and information on actions and results to enhance consistency within BTRs and to enable assessments of the effectiveness and adequacy of adaptation actions (3.3.5). Provide more information on GESI, especially how it is promoted through actions and the results achieved (box 3.1). 36 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty In the Fulani village of Hore Mondji, located in southern Mauritania on the banks of the Senegal River, a women\u2019s cooperative uses solar energy to operate",

Photo: \u00a9 World Vision 39 Key messages \u25b6 Based on a comprehensive update, the costs of adaptation are estimated to be in a plausible central range of US$310\u2013365 billion/year for developing countries by the year 2035 (in constant 2023 prices, not inflation-adjusted). This is based on two lines of evidence: \u25cf \u25cf An updated modelling analysis estimates adaptation costs at US$310 billion/year for developing countries by 2035. This is an increase from the previous Adaptation Gap Report (AGR). An updated assessment of submitted national adaptation plans (NAPs) and nationally determined contributions (NDCs), with extrapolation to all developing countries, estimates adaptation finance needs at US$365 billion/year for the period 2023\u20132035. International public adaptation finance flows to developing countries were tracked at US$26 billion in 2023 (in constant 2023 prices), a slight decline compared to 2022. Annual growth in these finance flows has averaged around 7 per cent per year (2019\u20132023), which is below the 12 per cent annual increase needed to meet the Glasgow Climate Pact of a doubling by 2025, and recent announcements increase the likelihood that this goal may not be achieved. Concessional finance accounted for 70 per cent of international public adaptation finance. However, non-concessional loans continue to increase, particularly towards middle-income countries, and exceeded the amount of concessional loans in 2023. This update",

Concessional finance accounted for 70 per cent of international public adaptation finance. However, non-concessional loans continue to increase, particularly towards middle-income countries, and exceeded the amount of concessional loans in 2023. This update shows that the adaptation finance gap is not reducing. The estimated future costs/ needs are approximately 12\u201314 times as much as international public flows. More positively, a higher relative proportion of finance is flowing to the more vulnerable countries, including least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS). An updated analysis indicates that since the last AGR assessment, there has been progress in incorporating gender equality and social inclusion considerations into costings in NDCs and NAPs, though this remains uneven. AGR 2025 has assessed the potential for the private sector to help bridge the finance gap, and estimates it could deliver 15\u201320 per cent of priority national adaptation needs in developing countries by 2035, primarily in market sectors and middle-income countries. It could be possible to deliver higher private sector investment, but only by passing costs back to developing countries. This also raises a new issue of the difference between the adaptation financing gap and the funding gap \u2013 this is critical for the negotiation discussions on sources of finance. Inflation needs to be taken into account when comparing the new AGR estimates of adaptation cost/financing needs (US$310\u2013365 billion/year) to the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) of at least US$300 billion/year by 2035 (in total) for mitigation and adaptation. Including inflation would increase the AGR values (above) to US$440\u2013520 billion/year by the year 2035. Based on scenario analysis, AGR estimates that the adaptation finance gap cannot be closed with international public finance alone. However, the finance gaps for LDCs and SIDS could theoretically be closed with international public finance, depending on the level of prioritization of finance flows towards these countries. \u25b6 \u25b6 \u25b6 \u25b6 \u25b6 \u25b6 \u25b6 \u25b6 40 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty \u25b6 The evidence from AGR 2025 provides insights and recommendations for the forthcoming negotiations and the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T.

Finance is therefore a key part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations. The Adaptation Gap Report (AGR) assesses progress on this through an analysis of the adaptation finance gap (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2014), as set out in box 4.1. Box 4.1 The adaptation finance gap AGR estimates the plausible adaptation finance gap for developing countries1 using several lines of evidence: 1. The estimated adaptation needs in US$. This is expressed as a range, based on two methods:2 \u25b6 A modelled estimate of the additional costs of adaptation for all developing countries, based on global sectoral models with national-level resolution \u25b6 An analysis of adaptation finance needs reported in developing countries\u2019 national adaptation plans (NAPs) and nationally determined contributions (NDCs), extrapolating these data to all developing countries 2. An analysis of international public adaptation finance flows in US$ to developing countries, aggregated from country-level data. The range from the modelled costs/finance needs (1) are compared to the current adaptation finance flows (2) to estimate the adaptation finance gap for developing countries. Note that in practice, quantifying this gap is challenging, both conceptually and analytically, and results can only be considered indicative. This focus on international public finance was in line with the goal for developed countries to mobilize US$100 billion of climate finance per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries (UNFCCC 2009), and the Glasgow Climate Pact, which urged developed country Parties to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing country Parties from 2019 levels by 2025 (UNFCCC 2022). Domestic finance of developing countries and private sector flows were not included. 1 Defined here as the non-Annex I countries under the UNFCCC. See https://unfccc.int/process/parties-non-party-stakeholders/parties-convention- and-observer-states. 2 While both methods estimate the costs of adaptation in US$, they involve different methods and definitions, and consider different adaptation activities and additionality, as well as considering different risks. See the AGR 2023 (UNEP 2023b) for further details. 41 Chapter 4 \u2013 Adaptation finance gap AGR 2025 has updated the adaptation finance gap.3 This is relevant for the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance (UNFCCC 2024a), with developed country Parties taking the lead of at least US$300 billion per year by 2035,",

AGR 2025 has therefore undertaken a deep dive on the potential role of the private sector. The NCQG text also highlights the need to achieve a balance between adaptation and mitigation, and take account of needs and priorities, especially those of the least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS); hence, these are considered separately. Finally, the US$300 billion goal was embedded within a larger call for action to scale up finance to at least US$1.3 trillion annually to developing country Parties by 2035, and the announced Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T. This chapter discusses initiatives that might help close the finance gap, and provides insights and suggestions for the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap. 4.2 The costs of adaptation in developing countries The first step in estimating the adaptation finance gap is to estimate the costs of adaptation. In simple terms, this can be assessed by estimating the current and future economic impacts of climate change, then assessing the costs of reducing these impacts (the reduction being the benefit of adaptation) (UNEP 2016). However, there is a trade-off involved over how much adaptation to undertake, and on the level of residual damage costs after adaptation. This reflects the fact that adaptation is rarely completely effective (for example, see Rexer and Siddharth [2024]). and that it usually becomes more costly (and less cost-effective) to deliver higher levels of risk reduction (UNEP 2023a). This residual damage (after adaptation) closely relates to the concept of loss and damage. As well as economics, the balance between adaptation costs and residual damage involves ethical and political considerations, and different actors will have varying views on the objectives, ambition and trade-offs involved. In practice, estimating the costs of adaptation is extremely challenging and there is no single definitive estimate, because costs depend on the objectives chosen, future warming levels and uncertainty, as well as on the definitions and methods used (UNEP 2023b). Further, adaptation should not be seen as a one-off decision (or cost) but an ongoing response to dynamically changing risks over time, i.e. as part of a continuous adaptive management process (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2022). Further discussion of why estimates of the adaptation costs can vary was presented in the",

Further discussion of why estimates of the adaptation costs can vary was presented in the adaptation finance gap update (UNEP 2023b). Noting these challenges, the AGR has provided updated estimates. 4.2.1 The modelled costs of adaptation The AGR uses a set of established, peer-reviewed sectoral models to estimate the additional costs of adaptation for developing countries \u2013 the incremental adaptation costs to address climate change \u2013 expressing these as annual undiscounted adaptation costs. The approach is documented in the adaptation finance update (UNEP 2023b) and summarized in annex 4.A. AGR 2025 has updated these costs. It has extended the estimates to the year 2035, in line with the target year of the NCQG. It has also re-run the models using the newer Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) projections (for multiple representative concentration pathways [RCPs]) and with updated models, notably for agriculture (Assessing Climate Change Risk in Europe [ACCREU]) and health (based on new costs of inaction analysis in World Bank [2024]).5 The results of this modelling analysis are shown in figure 4.1 below. The new estimates of the costs of adaptation in the year 2035 are approximately US$310 billion/year (constant 2023 prices, not inflation-adjusted, central estimate) for all developing countries, for an RCP4.5 scenario, though there is a large range around this value (see discussion in annex 4.A). Of this total, the costs for LDCs and SIDS are US$36.7 billion/year (LDCs are US$33.5 billion/year and SIDS are US$4.2 billion/year, noting some LDCs are also SIDS). 3 This chapter was co-financed by: i) the ECONOGENESIS project funded by United Kingdom aid from the United Kingdom Government and by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada as part of the Climate Adaptation and Resilience (CLARE) research programme (note that the views expressed herein do not necessarily represent those of the United Kingdom Government, IDRC or its Board of Governors); ii) the Assessing Climate Change Risk in Europe project (ACCREU), funded by the European Union through the Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Action (RIA) under grant agreement 101081358 and by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) under the United Kingdom Government\u2019s Horizon Europe Guarantee (reference number: 10073932) (note that the views and opinions expressed are, however, those of the author[s] only, and do not necessarily reflect those of the European Union.

Using the IHLEG grouping, the costs of adaptation for emerging market and developing economies are estimated at approximately US$235 billion/ year in 2035 (constant 2023 prices). costs arise (in 2035) from the objectives set (for example, due to the differences in adaptation costs but also residual damages between the economic optimal, maintaining current standards, or reducing all damages), the specific climate model (and if hotter, cooler, wetter or drier), and the impact model used and the representation of adaptation. The full range around the values above is therefore very large (see discussion in annex 4.A). The analysis also shows a greater divergence in adaptation costs between warming scenarios after 2040 \u2013 this highlights the need to achieve the Paris Agreement goals to reduce adaptation costs (and residual damage). The analysis has also looked at the potential difference in adaptation costs for different warming scenarios (RCPs). This finds that the differences between most RCPs (2.5, 4.5, 6.0) in the period 2030\u20132035 are relatively small (typically <10 per cent), as this near-term climate change is mostly locked in already (Arias et al. 2021). However, it does find higher adaptation costs for the more extreme warming scenarios (RCP8.5). Much larger differences in adaptation There are several additional issues to highlight with these estimates. First, there are additional costs of residual damage (after adaptation) on top of these adaptation costs, which are significant and are critical to consider when looking at costs and benefits overall (including analysis of losses and damages). Second, the values cover a limited number of risks, and thus reflect a partial analysis, and likely underestimate, of total adaptation costs (see box 4.2). 6 This increase can be explained as follows. The move from 2021 to constant 2023 prices increases the estimate to US$239 billion/year.

The following key omissions are highlighted. Further work to extend to these is a priority. \u25b6 There are additional adaptation costs to address overheating in the built environment, including for residential households. Emerging evidence (ACCREU 2025; De Cian et al. 2025) indicates these could be very large, at over US$50 billion/year in developing countries by 2035 if met through air conditioning (AC), though there is a question if these should be considered an impact or an adaptation. We note that developing countries do not include these AC costs in their NAP/NDC submissions. There are alternative planned adaptation actions to AC (see UNEP Cool Coalition), including passive ventilation, urban planning and green infrastructure, but aggregate adaptation costs do not exist (though these would involve significant costs and some public actions and funding, for example green space). be high (Aggarwal et al. 2024), and the costs of adaptation for ecosystem services outside of protected areas (costs above are for protected areas only, based on Waldron et al. 2020). The infrastructure costs are for climate-proofing new investment only \u2013 there are additional costs associated with retrofitting existing infrastructure stock. \u25b6 The values do not include all household expenditures on adaptation. There is some evidence that these are already significant in highly vulnerable countries (Eskander et al. 2022), although these often arise because of the lack of public adaptation investment. \u25b6 The values exclude the costs of adapting to cascading and compounding risks (IPCC 2022) or to major tipping points (Lenton et al. 2023), though many of the latter are beyond the limits of adaptation. \u25b6 The values above do not include the cost of financing (cost of capital) of adaptation. \u25b6 The values do not take account of all windstorm risks (coastal storm surge is included, but not wind damage), and do not consider wildfire risks.

These submissions include finance needs and contributions from both international climate finance and domestic sources (UNEP 2023a). The country-driven, bottom-up and dynamic nature of the information in NDCs and NAPs makes these an important source of evidence. These documents typically begin by identifying adaptation actions, then estimating the costs of implementation. The information provided is highly heterogeneous.7 However, not all adaptation needs identified in the countries\u2019 plans have been costed, potentially leading to an underestimation (UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance 2024). Further support to countries for costing adaptation needs remains a priority. As at 31 July 2025, 97 developing countries have submitted adaptation finance needs in either their NDC or NAP (UNFCCC 2025a; UNFCCC 2025b). More recent submissions reflect methodological improvements and broader coverage, and are more comprehensive and more realistic (Isah et al. 2025). For this analysis, we adopt a \u2018latest information first\u2019 approach, using the most recent submitted estimates from each country, and only reports submitted after 2020. Reported adaptation finance needs. The adaptation finance needs reported vary widely due to factors such as country size, economic structure, climate change impacts and vulnerability, as well as methodological approach. In relative terms, low-income countries report the highest adaptation finance needs, averaging 3.6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), followed by lower-middle-income countries at 2.4 per cent, upper-middle-income countries at 2.1 per cent, and high-income countries with lowest at 1.7 per cent. In contrast, per capita needs exhibit an inverse trend: countries with higher income levels report greater needs in absolute dollar terms. Low-income countries report an average of US$31 per capita, lower-middle-income countries US$62, upper-middle-income countries US$158, and high-income countries the highest at US$273. This suggests that lower-income countries have higher needs relative to the size of their economies.

To estimate global adaptation finance needs, reported annual finance needs from the 97 submitted documents were extrapolated to all 155 developing countries using a multivariate regression approach. This leads to an estimate of total adaptation finance needs of US$365 billion per year, with a range of US$144 billion\u20131,032 billion. The estimated annual adaptation finance needs for developing countries vary substantially across regions (see figure 4.2).

This may indicate that adaptation priorities evolve as countries develop. information for adaptation finance. There are additional domestic public and private flows, though data on these are more limited (UNEP 2024; Mizuno 2025) but improving (Connolly et al. 2024; Naran et al. 2025). However, domestic public sources of finance are excluded in this analysis, because the finance gap focuses on developed to developing countries\u2019 flows, reflecting the mandate in the UNFCCC text (United Nations 1992). Private sector flows are discussed in section 4.5.2. 4.3 International public adaptation finance flows The AGR 2025 updates the analysis of international public climate finance flows, from Annex II to non-Annex I UNFCCC Parties, covering the most recent five-year available period (2019\u20132023), based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). For further details, see annex 4.B. International public flows remain the most consistent and well-tracked source of 4.3.1 International public climate finance According to the OECD, commitment flows at face value8 from developed country shares of multilateral providers to developing countries reached a new historical high of US$99 billion (in constant 2023 prices) (figure 4.4). This estimate excludes mobilized private finance9 and export credits \u2013 when these are included, the flows exceed US$100 billion. Of this total, the largest share was for mitigation at 57 per cent, with only 28 per cent allocated to adaptation, and the remainder directed to cross-cutting initiatives (based on the 2022\u20132023 average). 8 A commitment is a financial obligation, offered in writing and backed by funds from a provider to a recipient country (OECD 2008). A grant equivalent is calculated for the debt instrument (e.g. loans), by multiplying the annual disbursements by the loan\u2019s grant element at the time of the commitment (Kiernan et al. 2024). Calculations of total climate finance based on grant equivalent estimates are significantly lower than the data reported by the OECD, with estimates at only US$35 billion in 2022 (Kowalzig et al. 2024). 9 Mobilized private finance for adaptation was provisionally estimated at US$3.9 billion in 2023 (constant 2023 prices) (OECD 2025a). 46 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty Figure 4.4 International public climate finance commitments from developed countries towards developing countries per year for the period 2019\u20132023, disaggregated into adaptation, mitigation and cross-cutting finance (US$",

This decline corresponds with a decrease in the multilateral development bank (MDB)10 flows attributable to developed countries, while bilateral finance held steady at US$9 billion\u201310 billion annually. As MDBs provide most (57 per cent) of the international public adaptation finance, their reduced contributions largely explain the overall decline. These flows are relevant for the Glasgow Climate Pact, and its aim to double the collective provision of climate finance for adaptation from developed to developing country Parties (from 2019 levels), which would be approximately US$40 billion by 2025.11 Over the period 2019\u20132023, international public adaptation finance grew at a compound annual growth rate of 7 per cent, exceeding the 6 per cent average annual growth in overall official development assistance (ODA) (Sabow et al. 2025), but falling short of the 12 per cent annual average increase required to meet the Glasgow Pact. However, further progress towards the Glasgow goal will be affected by the drop in ODA since 2023. ODA fell by 9 per cent in 2024 (relative to 2023) and further reductions have been announced for 2025, which are likely to lead to a further 9\u201317 per cent fall (OECD 2025b). The impact on climate finance will be different, and will depend on how ODA is allocated. This means future predictions are challenging because flows are sensitive to financial providers\u2019 priorities and shifting contexts (Nor and Mohamed 2024). Nevertheless, ODA falls after 2023 are likely to affect the achievability of the Glasgow Pact, and increase the likelihood that this may not be achieved.

One key addition for AGR 2025 is the additional calculation of developing countries\u2019 contributions as financial providers. 10 The MDB joint report declares US$23 billion in own resources for adaptation finance to low- and middle-income countries in 2023 (European Investment Bank 2024), which represents an increase relative to 2022. This amount includes non-flow financial instruments (e.g. guarantees) that are not included in the OECD Climate-Related Development Finance database. After applying coefficients to represent the share attributable to developed countries, the MDB adaptation finance in 2023 for the AGR amounted to US$14 billion, a reduction from the calculated US$17 billion in 2022 (see more details in annex 4.B). 11 In the 2022 Climate Finance Delivery Plan Progress Report, and in a joint letter published in 2023, developed countries confirmed their understanding that doubling adaptation finance implies an increase by contributors from the approximately US$20 billion provided and mobilized in 2019, to US$40 billion by 2025. Note that the doubling does not take inflation into account \u2013 see section 4.7.1. 47 Chapter 4 \u2013 Adaptation finance gap This is relevant in the context of the NCQG, which encourages contributions from developing countries, on a voluntary basis, towards the US$300 billion and US$1.3 trillion goals. If both developed and developing country flows (to developing countries) are included, international public adaptation finance rises by US$8 billion to US$35 billion in 2022\u20132023 (constant 2023 prices). This reflects an important contribution from developing countries of about 29 per cent, mainly through MDBs (see table 4.1). Table 4.1 International public adaptation finance considering developed and developing countries\u2019 contributions (average 2022\u20132023, in US$ billion, constant 2023 prices) US$ billion (average 2022\u20132023) Developed countries Developing countries Annex II Non-Annex I Annex I economies in transition MDBs Climate funds Other multilateral Total sources Note: Small errors may occur due to rounding. 9.4 15.4 1.5 0.7 26.9 0.5 0.0 7.2 0.0 0.2 7.9 Total 9.4 0.5 0.0 22.5 1.5 0.94 34.8 4.3.3 Financial instruments and distribution of flows instrument.

Grants averaged 39 per cent of international public adaptation finance in 2022\u20132023, and have increased at a 7 per cent compound annual growth rate since 2019. As non-debt concessional instruments, grants allow countries to address climate impacts without exacerbating debt, while supporting non-market-driven adaptation investments (Khan et al. 2020). However, non-concessional finance has also grown at a compound annual growth rate of 7 per cent from 2019 to 2023. In 2023, non-concessional loans exceeded concessional ones for the first time since 2019. This non- concessional funding was allocated mainly (89 per cent) to middle-income countries in 2022\u20132023, with only 2 per cent to low-income countries (including LDCs). The greater use of non-concessional finance is important in the context of the NCQG, which states the need for finance to \u201cimplement the nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans including through grants, concessional and non-debt creating instruments, and measures to create fiscal space\u201d (UNFCCC 2024a). Overall, debt instruments dominate adaptation finance flows, comprising 58 per cent on average, and are provided mainly by MDBs. This high reliance on debt has raised concerns about affordability and equity (Venner, Garc\u00eda- Lamarca and Olazabal 2024), and the risk of an \u201cadaptation investment trap\u201d that could limit future adaptation capacity while increasing vulnerability and debt (Bernhofen et al. 2024; Verschuur, Ranger and Hall 2025). In addition, given the nature of their business model, MDBs tend to prioritize financially viable projects. This underscores the need for complementary concessional financing to support high-development-impact, low-financial-return adaptation initiatives. However, achieving such complementarity can be complex, as MDBs influence the perceived viability of development investments (Bazbauers 2022; Bazbauers 2025). 48 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty Figure 4.5 International public adaptation finance from developed to developing countries (Annex II to non-Annex I UNFCCC Parties), by concessionality level and instrument, 2019\u20132023 ) s e c i r p t n a t s n o c 3 2 0 2 ( n o i l l i b $ S U 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 0.16 6.35 9.90 8.25 6.12 7.03 7.77 0.40 6.10 5.40 7.86 0.59 0.44 0.40 6.28 9.75 0.94 0.52 7.57 6.73 10.86 10.17 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Grant (concessional) Loan (concessional) Loan (non-concessional) Loan (not specified) Other (all) Note: Other instruments include equity and mezzanine finance.

Values are rounded; minor differences may be present. International public adaptation finance commitments in vulnerable country groups. The Paris Agreement and the NCQG recognize LDCs\u2019 and SIDS\u2019 specific vulnerability, and in response international public adaptation finance has prioritized these groups. Of the total, an average of US$10.4 billion (36 per cent of the total) in 2022\u20132023 was allocated to LDCs. MDBs were the main providers for these flows at 62 per cent, with 51 per cent grants and 49 per cent debt instruments. Non-concessional debt was limited (10 per cent), but any reliance on international debt instruments for LDCs raises concerns over fiscal space (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] 2024). SIDS were allocated an average of US$1.2 billion in 2022\u20132023, 57 per cent from MDBs. Most finance came through grants (55 per cent), while non-concessional loans (26 per cent) exceeded concessional ones (17 per cent) due to income-based eligibility limits. In light of this, SIDS have called for concessional finance eligibility criteria to reflect climate vulnerability (Akiwumi 2022). This does show that a higher relative share of international public adaptation finance is being directed towards the most vulnerable countries. Nonetheless, the flows are still modest relative to needs: per capita adaptation finance in 2022\u20132023 was US$9 in LDCs and US$20 in SIDS, both lower than in previous years. 4.4 The updated adaptation finance gap The three lines of evidence from the sections above are brought together to provide an updated estimate of the adaptation finance gap. Based on modelled costs of adaptation and the submitted/extrapolated adaptation finance needs (sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2), the updated plausible central range for the adaptation costs/financing needs is approximately US$310 billion/year\u2013US$365 billion/year for developing countries for 2035 (constant 2023 prices). This is shown in figure 4.6 (red bars). This equates to 0.7 to 0.8 per cent of current GDP for all developing countries. Of this total, adaptation costs/finance needs for LDCs and SIDS together are US$35 billion/year (modelled) and US$50 billion/year (finance needs-based extrapolation). These ranges have narrowed since AGR 2023, as the modelled cost estimates have increased while extrapolated estimated costs from NDCs and NAPs have slightly decreased. These values can be compared to current international public adaptation finance flows to developing countries (section 4.3), which were tracked at US$26 billion in 2023 (constant 2023 prices), a slight decline compared to 2022 (see figure 4.6, solid blue bar). 49 Chapter 4 \u2013 Adaptation finance gap Figure 4.6 Comparison of adaptation financing needs, modelled",

Climate change is projected to affect the poorest and most vulnerable people the most in relative terms, because these groups have fewer resources, higher vulnerability and lower adaptive capacity (UNEP 2023b). It is also likely to exacerbate inequality across multiple dimensions of social identity, including gender (Roy et al. 2022). It is therefore critical to ensure that adaptation finance reaches those who need it most, and that financing and funding is inclusive, equitable and responsive to differential vulnerabilities. However, AGR 2023 (UNEP 2023a) identified that less than 17 per cent of international public adaptation finance commitments were dedicated to projects with a specific focus on local An updated review of recent NAPs and NDC3.0s has been undertaken in AGR 2025 to assess the progress on costed programming of gender and social inclusion.

However, this remains uneven across regions and sectors. There are different approaches to GESI considerations in NAPs/NDCs, and the methodologies for defining and financing are often opaque. Most interventions focus on gender equality rather than other aspects of social inclusion (Indigeneity, age or disability). The levels of detail and specificity also vary across the documents, even when they fall into the same GESI category. For example, GESI-integrative NAPs/ NDCs may acknowledge GESI differences and ensure that targeting provides opportunities for inclusion, yet differ significantly in how these commitments are articulated. For example, the Republic of Moldova\u2019s NDC outlines a five-year gender-sensitive communication strategy to increase awareness, while Bangladesh\u2019s NAP includes operationalized interventions.

There is also a growing grey literature that identifies large future markets for adaptation goods and services (e.g. Collins et al. 2024; Oehling et al. 2025; Wong and Kim 2025). To investigate these issues, AGR 2025 has undertaken a quantitative analysis of private sector adaptation potential using the AGR modelled cost data set (see section 4.2.1). It is stressed that such an analysis is challenging, and that input data and methodological assumptions significantly affect the results (noting that different actors will have differing views on assumptions). The analysis presented below should therefore be treated as an indicative analysis. The full analysis is presented in a supplementary paper (Watkiss and England 2025). \u25b6 Dedicated budgets for GESI commitments vary, from as little as 0.01 per cent to as much as 12 per cent of total adaptation finance needs. Positively, an increasing number of countries report the alignment between their adaptation policies and national gender equality strategies. Some countries have also integrated gender into public financial systems, suggesting they are further along in financing GESI in adaptation. In the long term, mainstreaming GESI into existing systems is likely to improve equity, but at the current time, dedicated and ring-fenced budgets may be a stronger indication of GESI commitment. 4.6.1 Framing the private sector role for adaptation There are existing activities that are typically provided by the public sector, as well as existing markets for private goods and services: adaptation can be mapped onto these.15 These are linked to the financial returns of adaptation (OECD 2023). Some adaptation actions generate low or no returns, and are likely to be provided by the public sector, while other actions are commercially viable and will be provided by the private sector. Between these are adaptation actions that may provide below-market returns and/or where there are market failures, and where there may be roles for both the public and private sectors. These aspects have been used to build a typology for adaptation (shown in figure 4.7) that includes three categories: This issue is linked to the NCQG, which urges the inclusion and extension of climate finance to vulnerable communities and groups, including women and girls, and other marginalized groups.

However, without specific minimum allocation targets, or shares of funding dedicated to GESI- related actions, there is no guarantee that this will happen. This could be addressed with concrete tracking, guidance, mechanisms and even targets for GESI integration \u2013 even if done as an intermediate step, as part of a move to a GESI responsive system. Finally, a broader set of initiatives could be introduced to support GESI-targeted as well as locally led components and activities. These could include tailored A. B. Adaptation activities which the public sector typically delivers, such as public goods or in non-market sectors, e.g. major flood protection projects. These involve public costs and provide public benefits, including for the private sector. Mixed areas where government may act to address market failures to deliver more positive welfare outcomes, e.g. for climate-smart agriculture due to its positive environmental benefits, and/ or where public action can help make adaptation commercially viable. 15 The role of government is set out in economic public policy theory (e.g. United Kingdom, HM Treasury 2022). This is based on the societal case to act (intervention), considering social and environmental costs and benefits, not just market costs and benefits. In contrast, the private sector will primarily act where there are profitable opportunities, though also to manage risks. 52 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty C. Adaptation within existing well-functioning markets that already provide commercial returns, where governments do not normally intervene, e.g. AC in factories. These purely private actions will, in turn, have fiscal benefits for public finances.

These are the focus of this analysis, i.e. we look at the potential role of the private sector for these NAP and NDC priorities. It is stressed that these AGR estimates do not include the costs of pure private activities, i.e. category C above. For example, NAPs do not include the costs of fitting new AC in households or climate-proofing private assets. This means that there are additional adaptation costs for the private sector in developing countries, on top of the AGR estimates. These additional private adaptation costs are estimated very indicatively to be at least US$250 billion/year for developing countries by 2035 (see box 4.3). However, we assume that these pure private sector adaptation costs will be financed entirely by the private sector.16 16 This is a simplification, and there are some important issues to note. First, governments may seek to create the enabling environment for the private sector to act in these areas \u2013 this is already being advanced with disclosure and transition planning. It may also act if these private actions create external costs, e.g. AC greenhouse gas emissions. Second, the additional costs of private adaptation will be likely to be passed on in the price of goods and services, and/or may also alter the comparative advantage of the private sector of developing countries. There are therefore some complex issues around whether this is equitable. 53 Chapter 4 \u2013 Adaptation finance gap Box 4.3 What are the additional adaptation costs/finance needs for the private sector? The estimate of pure private sector adaptation costs (category C in figure 4.7) have not previously been included in the AGR, because they fall outside of the needs identified by developing country Parties. However, these costs are critical, and many recent studies include them when looking at private sector finance flows (Naran et al. 2025). There is some evidence emerging on these. There will be large adaptation costs for climate-proofing and retrofitting private sector assets, for example, factories, privately owned infrastructure, etc. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) (Aligishiev, Bellon and Massetti 2022) estimates these costs could total 0.4\u20130.6 per cent",

Using the factors from the IMF report, and focusing on climate-proofing of new private infrastructure only, AGR provisionally estimates adaptation costs at US$150 billion/year for developing countries by 2035. A further large cost will be associated with adapting to the impacts of heat on the labour force (on labour supply and reduced working time, as well as labour productivity and reduced output). While there are some public actions, such as public heat alerts, the majority of adaptation will be delivered by the private sector itself, e.g. with AC for indoor work, shifting labour activities, and protective measures or mechanization for outdoor work. Indicative analysis (ACCREU 2025) indicates that these adaptation costs could be large, with additional indoor cooling alone costs potentially in excess of US$100 billion/year for developing countries by 2035. For this analysis, it is important to identify the private sector roles in adaptation. These include: \u25b6 \u25b6 \u25b6 Financing: The private financial sector and private investors can play a key role in financing public adaptation, e.g. for sovereign green bonds, and they also play a similar role for financing private adaptation. There are also opportunities for financial services companies and intermediaries, from both developed and developing countries. These actors also have a role in disclosure and transition planning, and can help other private actors to adapt. Delivering adaptation goods and services: Adaptation provides the private sector with new market opportunities for adaptation goods and services, for both the public and private sectors (e.g. increased government procurement contracts, providing AC for factories). This can involve large multinational companies through to small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries. Addressing their own needs: Private sector companies will address their own adaptation needs, by investing in their own assets and supply chains to manage risks. model for adaptation, i.e. how the upfront costs of investment are met, and the financial instruments involved. This focuses on the role of the public and/or private actors in providing the money to implement adaptation, through relevant financial instruments with associated terms (including financing costs such as interest, i.e. the cost of capital).

Alongside the issue of financing, there is a separate question regarding the funding of adaptation, i.e. how to pay for adaptation over the lifetime of the investment and how these costs (including the financing costs and the cost of capital) will be paid for. This relates to the cost recovery mechanism and requires consideration of whether the funding is from the public budget, from user charges, etc. This introduces a new set of terms to AGR, and highlights a key difference between the adaptation finance gap and the adaptation funding gap. It also means that scaling up private sector finance for delivering categories A and B runs the risk of simply passing costs back to developing countries, helping the financing but not the funding gap.17 This would not align to the UNFCCC CBDR-CR principles or the NCQG text on the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap. It is also important (Fay et al. 2021; UNEP 2024) to differentiate between: Who finances adaptation? (i.e. where does the money come from?) This relates to the source of finance and the financing 4.6.2 Analysis of current and potential future private flows Baseline. The analysis has started by looking at current private adaptation finance flows. This is based on two data sets, for different types of private flows. First, the OECD tracks private adaptation finance mobilized from international 17 As an example, private capital markets can invest in sovereign green bonds that provide the finance for public adaptation, such as flood protection, but it is the developing country government that provides the funding for these investments (i.e. that pays). Similarly, a private utility water company could finance adaptation infrastructure (e.g. building new reservoirs), but it will be the utility customers in the developing country that pay for this through increased user charges. Finally, new adaptation goods and services provided by the private sector (e.g. new technologies for farmers) will be paid for by local farmers; while this provides benefits in reducing climate impacts, unless these actions generate net financial benefits, there is an additional cost (relative to the counterfactual without climate change). 54 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty public adaptation finance. This was tracked at US$3.5 billion in 2022 (OECD 2024) and provisionally18 at US$3.9 billion in 2023 (constant 2023 prices). These mobilized flows are an important contribution to international adaptation finance (e.g. 11 per cent of US$32.4 billion in 2023), but they are only approximately 1 per cent of the estimated adaptation cost/finance needs for 2035 (of US$310\u2013365 billion/year). Second, the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) has developed an approach to assess additional private sector adaptation finance flows (Connolly et al. 2024) and estimates that globally, over",

Second, the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) has developed an approach to assess additional private sector adaptation finance flows (Connolly et al. 2024) and estimates that globally, over the period 2019\u20132022, these were US$4.7 billion/year. The recent 2025 update (Naran et al. 2025) reports that tracked private adaptation finance flows amounted to US$5.74 billion globally for 2023; excluding North America and Europe, the figure is US$4.4 billion. This represents approximately 1.5 per cent of the estimated adaptation cost/finance needs for 2035. It is noted that these private flows are likely to be a significant underestimate as tracking these flows is difficult, but also that the majority of these flows are likely to be category C adaptation (see figure 4.7).19 With the best information currently available, and noting the caveats, the combination of OECD mobilized private investment and the CPI private finance flows indicate total flows of between US$4 billion and 9 billion/year, which is equivalent to 1\u20133 per cent of total adaptation finance needs by 2035. The tracked amount that is flowing to publicly identified national priorities (see figure 4.7) is likely to be less than this, and can very indicatively be estimated here as US$5 billion. This indicates that current (tracked) private flows have not yet had a large impact on reducing the adaptation finance gap. Private sector potential. AGR 2025 has looked at the potential for scaling up private sector investment in delivering categories A (public) and B (mixed adaptation) in developing countries, i.e. the publicly identified priorities. This analysis has used the modelled costs of adaptation (section 4.2.1), as this contains disaggregated adaptation cost data by activity and by sector for each individual developing country. The analysis assessed the potential financial returns for each adaptation option, using the typology developed by OECD (2023), as well as analysis of current public and private splits for each action for different country income groupings. This level of resolution is needed because the split of public/private potential varies with the sector, the specific adaptation activity, and for each activity, by individual country. The full analysis is presented in the supplementary paper by Watkiss and England (2025). It is stressed that this initial analysis excludes the role of the private sector in financing national public adaptation through sovereign debt. The results provide some key insights. A large proportion (approximately 40 per cent) of publicly identified priority adaptation investments are public goods.20 A further 35 per cent are in areas that are typically provided by the public sector, as they involve quasi-public goods (e.g. climate-proofing new roads) or because they are",

This means that approximately three quarters (75 per cent) would conventionally be provided (and funded) by the public sector. It is noted that these adaptation actions have high economic (societal) returns, but lower financial returns, because of no or low revenue generation. The remaining 25 per cent involves actions where there is the theoretical potential for private sector involvement, with returns that may be mixed or commercial. These are primarily in agriculture, some aspects of water (use), and infrastructure. However, the realistic potential for the private sector is lower than this, reflecting current levels of public and private investment in each sector, and lower commercial viability in less developed countries. When aggregated up, the analysis indicates that the realistic potential for the private sector for public adaptation priorities is between 15 and 20 per cent by 2035 (approximately US$55 billion per year of the total cost of US$310 billion/year), as an average for all developing countries. This low value is not surprising, given the focus on public priorities for adaptation. The values are broadly in line with other recent estimates, e.g. from the Asian Development Bank climate adaptation investment plan studies.21 18 This estimate includes MDBs\u2019 mobilization in full, without discounting for the significant marker. 19 Total private flows are likely to be higher than the values above, and the numbers exclude flows associated with households. However, tracked private flows are dominated by commercial financial institutions (53 per cent) and are likely to be finance not funding, and they are heavily weighted to company activities that are pure private sector adaptation flows (category C), which are outside the scope of this analysis. Further research and refinement on this issue is needed. 20 Public goods are goods or services that are beneficial to society, i.e. that are available to all (non-excludable) and that can be enjoyed by anyone without diminishing the benefits they deliver to others (non-rivalrous). Public goods are usually funded by governments because, due to their characteristics, they will not be supplied \u2013 or will be undersupplied \u2013 by the private sector. 21 A more difficult question to answer is whether this private sector investment specifically reduces the adaptation funding gap, as well as the financing gap. There is literature on the positive economic returns of adaptation (Global Commission on Adaptation 2018; Brandon et al. 2025),",

There is literature on the positive economic returns of adaptation (Global Commission on Adaptation 2018; Brandon et al. 2025), but much less evidence on the financial returns of adaptation, There are some private activities that have revenue models that can generate positive financial returns that fund adaptation, notably those that deliver yield improvements for agriculture or cost savings for water use (Oehling et al. 2025). However, financial returns are typically lower than economic returns even in sectors such as agriculture (World Bank 2019; World Bank 2021). 55 Chapter 4 \u2013 Adaptation finance gap Figure 4.8 The indicative level of potential private funding for adaptation in developing countries by 2035 (based on the incremental modelled costs of adaptation) 4% 12% 7% 11% 22% 78% 9% 88% 93% 89% 18% 82% s d e e n g n i d n u f n o i t a t p a d a f o e g a t n e c r e P 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 All developing countries Low-income countries Lower-middle- income countries Upper-middle- income countries LDCs SIDS Private opportunities Public dominated Reaching this level is also likely to require international public finance, to catalyse and de-risk private investment, including blended finance. The potential for this has been assessed in detail by Watkiss and England (2025) and is summarized in box 4.4. This indicates that while blended finance has an important strategic role, especially in the agriculture, water and infrastructure sections, the current evidence strongly suggests that it is unlikely to be effective in for scaling up adaptation across other areas \u2013 particularly public-focused priorities. It will also require significant volumes of public finance (international public finance) to deliver the anticipated private sector flows. The exact value varies by sector and country. There are higher estimated private shares for middle-income countries (figure 4.8) and for some sectors (e.g. agriculture). Conversely there are higher public shares (over 90 per cent) needed for LDCs. This reflects the nature of their adaptation needs, e.g. high public health and social cash transfers, their current high reliance on ODA for external financing (OECD 2025c), and their smaller and less developed private sectors. A high level of public finance is also estimated for SIDS (90 per cent) because of their high coastal protection needs, which traditionally have been publicly funded.

This is possible, but will require concerted policy action and enabling factors. A number of initiatives are already under way and offer the potential for this private sector scale-up. These include adaptation investment planning, country platforms and adaptation taxonomies, as well as encouraging greater private sector participation in NAPs and NDCs. 56 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty Box 4.4 The potential for blended finance for adaptation Many recent studies (e.g. OECD 2023; Network for Greening the Financial System 2025; Ranger et al. 2025) identify the opportunity for blended finance, which is where public enabling actions or public sector finance is used to de- risk and unlock private sector investment. To investigate this, AGR 2025 was granted access to and reviewed the Convergence database22 (Convergence Blended Finance 2024). This includes 102 pure adaptation deals between 2006 and 2024, with a total deal volume of US$10.6 billion. The volume and number of deals was dominated by agriculture (43 per cent of transactions and 60 per cent of finance), followed by biodiversity and ecosystems (14 per cent and 10 per cent), infrastructure (14 per cent and 9 per cent) and water (9 per cent and 13 per cent). There were no identifiable deals relating to coastal, river floods or early warning systems, likely due to their strong public good characteristics. The data also provides information on the amount of finance mobilized. This is usually measured with the leverage ratio \u2013 the ratio of concessional capital relative to all capital in a transaction (Convergence Blended Finance 2024). The average leverage ratios for adaptation, at 2:1, are much lower than mitigation (3.6:1) and sustainable development more broadly (4:1) (Apampa 2023; Convergence Blended Finance 2024). For this analysis, however, we are more interested in the amount of private sector finance mobilized. Traditional mobilization ratios assess the total private capital from a dollar of concessional capital, whether public or private. These ratios are circa 2:1 for climate, including mitigation (Convergence Blended Finance 2024) but likely to be lower for adaptation. However, the private finance mobilized from total public (concessional and non-concessional) is most relevant here (and in terms of the NCQG). Analysis of the data finds that this ratio is only 0.5:1, meaning that, for every US$1 of public finance (concessional and non-concessional), only ca US$0.5 of private finance is mobilized. Again, these lower ratios reflect the characteristics",

These findings are in line with other studies (Mazzucato and Vieira de S\u00e1 2025; Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences 2025), and also identify the greater challenge for blended finance in low-income countries, though blended adaptation deals are relatively new, there could be scope to improve private mobilization. Further details on the analysis are presented in Watkiss and England (2025). 22 AGR 2025 acknowledges and thanks Convergence for access to their database.

We stress that the views and opinions expressed in this section are those of the author(s) only, and do not reflect those of Convergence. 57 Chapter 4 \u2013 Adaptation finance gap 4.6.3 What might be possible with more innovative approaches? There are numerous studies that recommend new financing solutions or arrangements (Stoll et al. 2021; Gouett, Murphy and Parry 2023), including new business models that align risk ownership and/or adaptation costs with adaptation benefits and co-benefits (Richmond et al. 2021; Wise et al. 2022; England et al. 2023). This raises an interesting question of whether these innovative approaches could unlock more private sector financing and funding, beyond the estimated 15\u201320 per cent presented above. AGR 2025 has explored a number of lines of evidence to look at these innovative approaches and assess their potential. This has also considered whether these new approaches reduce the adaptation financing or funding gap, by looking at their cost recovery models, using an extension of an existing taxonomy developed by the World Bank (2025a). Further details are provided in the supplementary analysis (Watkiss and England 2025). Accelerators and facilities. A first line of evidence was to explore the innovation in the private sector by looking at adaptation accelerators and facilities. These provide support for new private sector adaptation ideas, including adaptation goods and services, as well as business models and financial instruments (noting these include existing ideas or financing models from other areas that are applied to adaptation, as well as more innovative adaptation specific models). They typically include a central facility to provide early-stage support, for example with technical assistance and sometimes innovation grants, alongside offers of concessional lending, guarantees or equity to de-risk investment. These are being complemented with adaptation platforms",

These are being complemented with adaptation platforms that help connect developers and potential investors. AGR 2025 investigates a database of projects funded by five of the global adaptation accelerator programmes,23 which includes 107 projects. An analysis of these found that they are very focused on the agriculture sector (52 per cent of all projects), followed by biodiversity and ecosystems, and infrastructure, but with fewer viable private models in more public areas (e.g. social protection, river flood protection and health). The analysis also found that more projects were targeted at middle-income countries (72) than for LDCs (35). The approach to cost recovery in these project models varies widely. There are examples that generate net financial benefits (yield improvements, carbon credit revenues), but many are based on local charges, or on goods and services that primarily reduce risks. This reinforces the findings that there is high potential to boost private sector financing and funding of adaptation in some, but not all, sectors and localities. Case studies. A second line of evidence was to review emerging case study applications, including from developed countries. AGR 2025 undertook a literature review and built up a series of sector assessments, populated by case studies, to identify additional innovation. This found that there is the potential to deliver a higher level of private sector investment than the 15\u201320 per cent value presented above, even in more public-focused sectors (e.g. flood protection). However, while these models provided a way of financing adaptation, most of the revenue and cost recovery models involved payment by governments or user charges to households. They therefore transfer the costs of adaptation back to the developing country itself, reducing the financing gap, but not the funding gap. Further, many of the models in more public sectors required broader reforms, for example, moving to water privatization or passing all agriculture research and development to the private sector. These reforms will not be easy to implement politically, and could also have potentially negative distributional impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable. More positively, a smaller number of case studies showed the potential to help fund as well as finance adaptation, due to their more innovative cost recovery models. Examples included land value capture, mitigation co-benefit models, market-based ecosystem approaches, and supply chain finance. These capture new benefit streams which can help fund adaptation, and offer the greatest potential for bridging the adaptation funding gap.

Further analysis of their potential is a priority, including their potential in different contexts, and if there are risks of maladaptation. It is extremely difficult to know what these more positive funding models could achieve, though it is the judgment of the authors that their contribution is likely to be modest, and that these innovative models often still require some public finance for delivery. Technology and digital. There is further innovation potential from technological advances, digital and artificial intelligence (AI), which could reduce down the costs of adaptation as well as providing more innovative financing solutions. Learning and economies of scale has dramatically reduced the costs of some renewables, some of which can be relevant for adaptation (e.g. solar irrigation). There is also the potential for cost savings for mature adaptation solutions (e.g. climate-proofing of roads), where new digital solutions help optimize targeting of action to reduce costs (Mazarine Climate 2025). There is also growing interest in the use of AI for providing local risk information and supporting adaptation decisions (e.g. with precision farming) that can lead to improved information as well as cost-saving. At the current time, there is insufficient evidence on how these could affect adaptation costs, but further investigation is a priority. 23 The database was created for AGR 2024 (England et al. 2023; UNEP 2024) and updated here to include 26 new projects funded from the accelerators. It includes adaptation projects from the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance, Global Environment Facility Challenge Program for Adaptation Innovation, Global Innovation Fund Innovating for Climate Resilience Fund, Promoting Entrepreneurship for Sustainable Development (SEED) and GSMA Innovation Fund for Climate Resilience and Adaptation. 58 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty 4.6.4 Private sector summary Overall, the AGR 2025 analysis suggests that for the publicly identified adaptation priorities that are the focus of NAPs and NDCs, and noting these values are indicative only, the private sector could potentially meet 15\u201320 per cent of adaptation needs by 2035. Achieving this level would involve a significant scale up from today from approximately US$5 billion to over US$50 billion per annum. This level is more modest than many recent assessments assume, and it indicates that while it has a role, the private sector alone cannot fill the adaptation finance gap. The potential for the private sector potential will also vary, and will be higher in certain sectors and in middle-income countries. Achieving this private share will require concerted policy action.

The potential for the private sector potential will also vary, and will be higher in certain sectors and in middle-income countries. Achieving this private share will require concerted policy action. It also likely to need international public finance, to catalyse and de-risk private investment. This creates tension due to the dual role for international public finance, both in supporting public adaptation directly, as well as in scaling up private sector investment. Finally, a higher private sector level of financing might be possible, but only by passing most of the costs of adaptation back to developing countries. The analysis here also reveals that insufficient attention has been given to the distinction between financing and funding. AGR 2025 highlights that this issue needs to be brought out more transparently in negotiation discussions. 4.6.5 Domestic finance and the adaptation finance gap The other main source of potential finance for bridging the gap is domestic public finance. The analysis of adaptation finance needs (in section 4.2.2) provides some relevant information here, as some countries have documented their unconditional flows, which would be primarily met from domestic public finance. However, for those countries that have specified unconditional finance, these are only around 5 per cent of needs. Looking forward, it is likely that domestic public finance will become a more important flow, especially in the context of changing international public adaptation, and we highlight this as a topic that requires more detailed assessment in the coming years. 4.7 Closing the gap and the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap After four years of negotiations, the NCQG was agreed at the twenty-ninth Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 29), with developed countries taking the lead in mobilizing at least US$300 billion per year by 2035 for developing countries. However, the NCQG left open the shares of public and private finance; the share of grant financing; the trajectory of increasing climate finance towards 2035; and how finance is balanced between mitigation and adaptation. As highlighted in section 4.2.3, it is likely that there will be less ODA and, by implication, less international public adaptation finance available than previously anticipated. A steep increase will therefore be necessary to mobilize the NCQG goal of US$300 billion per year by 2035. 4.7.1 Climate finance and inflation In order to compare the new AGR 2025 estimates of adaptation costs to the climate finance goal of the NCQG, it is critical to do so on a like-for-like basis. The NCQG is highly sensitive to the price year and would be much higher (by 2035) if it was inflation-adjusted (Gabbatiss 2024). However, the NCQG",

The NCQG is highly sensitive to the price year and would be much higher (by 2035) if it was inflation-adjusted (Gabbatiss 2024). However, the NCQG text does not specify the goal will be increased with inflation (the previous US$100 billion goal was not), and we assume it represents US$300 billion of finance in the year 2035. While future inflation levels are extremely hard to predict, historical rates provide some indications of possible levels.24 For example, over the past decade, global inflation has varied between 2.5 per cent in 2020 to a high of 8 per cent in 2022. As an illustration, we have applied a 3 per cent fixed annual level of inflation, which is close to the 10-year historical average inflation rate, and is approximately in line with near-term projections over the next couple of years (e.g. World Bank 2025b). A breakdown of alternative rates is included in annex 4.A. A fixed 3 per cent annual inflation rate would imply that the NCQG goal of US$300 billion in 2035 would only equate to approximately US$210 billion in constant 2023 prices (see figure 4.9). This allows for a direct comparison to the updated AGR estimates of US$310\u2013365 billion/year in constant 2023 prices. Alternatively, the future NCQG value of US$300 billion of climate finance in 2035 can be compared to an inflation-adjusted AGR value; in this case the AGR estimates (US$310\u2013365 billion/year) would be equivalent to US$440\u2013520 billion in 2035 (see figure 4.9). Either way, this highlights that the NCQG will be insufficient to even meet adaptation needs \u2013 noting further that the NCQG goal is for mitigation and adaptation finance, and does not include the additional costs of the residual damage after adaptation. This issue of inflation is also relevant for the Glasgow Pact (see box 4.5). 24 There are different metrics for assessing inflation. This analysis draws on GDP deflators, as these are considered more representative of the types of expenditure needed for adaptation than consumer price indices. 59 Chapter 4 \u2013 Adaptation finance gap Figure 4.9 Illustration of the effect of future inflation (illustrated with 3 per cent fixed) on the AGR estimates (in blue) and the US$300 billion NCQG goal (in red) r a e y / n o i l l i b $ S U 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 AGR - finance needs with inflation AGR - modelled costs with inflation NCQG ($2023) with inflation NCQG ($2035) no inflation NCQG = US$300 billion 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 Box",

This doubling target does not take account of inflation. However, including inflation would make a significant difference, and the 2019 volume of finance flows (US$20 billion) would be approximately US$23.5 billion in current prices \u2013 a doubling would indicate US$47 billion by 2025, rather than US$40 billion. The issue of inflation is also extremely important for the emerging discussion on a follow-up goal to the Glasgow Pact. This discussion would benefit from including analysis of inflation explicitly. It is also relevant for the statement issued by the MDBs at COP 29 (see above), which set a goal of US$49 billion for adaptation by 2030. 4.7.2 Closing the adaptation finance gap by 2035 Assuming that the US$300 billion (in 2035 prices) NCQG is reached by 2035, AGR 2025 has developed two illustrative scenarios to better understand the amount of international adaptation finance this could translate into for developing countries. These scenarios are not necessarily realistic \u2013 their purpose is to explore the potential of the NCQG for bridging the adaptation finance gap. In the minimum adaptation scenario, it is assumed that the share of adaptation finance in 2035 will resemble the historical, cumulative share of international public adaptation finance for developing countries from the period 2010-2020, which was 26 per cent of all international climate finance. This would amount to US$78 billion in international adaptation finance (i.e. 26 per cent of the US$300 billion) in 2035. Based on historical allocations, this would result in US$3 billion for SIDS and US$25 billion for LDCs. In the maximum adaptation scenario, it is assumed that the Glasgow Pact pledge is achieved (US$40 billion by 2025; see section 4.3.2 and box 4.5), and that this amount is tripled by 2030, in line with a proposal by the LDCs for the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap (LDC Group on Climate Change 2025).25 This would lead to ca US$120 billion in adaptation finance by 2030.

When assuming 2019 allocations as a base, this would result in US$6 billion for SIDS and US$55 billion for LDCs in 2035. Two important conclusions can be drawn based on this indicative quantification of financial flows (see table 4.4). First, even if the NCQG is achieved, a significant adaptation finance gap is likely to remain in 2035, regardless of the share of international public climate finance that will flow towards adaptation.26 Table 4.4 Potential amounts of international adaptation finance in 2035, assuming the NCQG is met, for minimum and maximum adaptation scenarios Amount of international adaptation finance (of the NCQG) in 2035* US$78 billion Minimum scenario Maximum scenario US$166 billion Modelled costs (see section 4.2.1) Finance needs (see section 4.2.2) Modelled costs of LDCs and SIDS Finance needs (NAPs/NDCs) of LDCs and SIDS US$310 billion (constant 2023 prices) US$365 billion (constant 2023 prices) With inflation, could be US$440 billion/year by 2035 (see figure 4.9) With inflation, could be US$520 billion/year by 2035 (see figure 4.9) LDCs: US$34 billion/year SIDS US$4 billion/ year SIDS and LDCs (without overlap): US$37 billion/year LDCs: US$46 billion/year SIDS: US$6 billion/year LDCs and SIDS (without overlap): US$50 billion/year With inflation, SIDS and LDCs could be US$53 billion/year by 2035 With inflation, could be US$71 billion/year in 2035 Note: * It is assumed that the goal to mobilize US$300 billion (in 2035 prices) is reached by 2035. See text for explanations of assumptions. Second, international adaptation finance flows under both the minimum and the maximum scenario would be enough to close the adaptation finance gap in 2035 for all LDCs and all SIDS (see table 4.4), noting the Paris Agreement and NCQG allow for prioritization of these vulnerable countries. Under the minimum scenario, however, this would require an allocation of 47\u201364 per cent of all available international adaptation finance (even assuming the NCQG was met). This would leave only US$28 billion\u201333 billion in total for all other developing countries, and far less when taking inflation into account.

Furthermore, LDCs\u2019 and SIDS\u2019 need for grant-based and highly concessional finance was acknowledged in the NCQG, implying that other developing countries would get a higher share of loans, especially non- concessional loans (UNFCCC 2024a, paragraph 14). The maximum scenario would require an allocation of 22\u201330 per cent of all international adaptation finance to LDCs and SIDS. This seems more equitable, but the likelihood of achieving the NCQG and delivering this level of adaptation finance (over 50 per cent of the NCQG) is low. Finally, an issue that was not mentioned in the Paris Agreement but that features in the NCQG are the unsustainable debt levels faced by many developing countries. Public expenditure of developing countries (excluding China) on interest on debt outweighs climate investments as a percentage of GDP (UNCTAD 2024). Between 2016 and 2020, SIDS spent almost 18 times more in debt repayments than they received in climate finance (Fresnillo and Crotti 2022). These existing high debts, increasing climate change impacts and a lack of adaptation finance together increase the risk of an \u2018adaptation investment trap\u2019, where the rising costs of climate disasters increase indebtedness and make it much harder for countries to invest in adaptation and resilience, in turn putting them at even higher risk (Ameli et al. 2021). 26 It is stressed that from an economic point of view, it should not be the role of the public sector to cover the full costs of adaptation (UNEP 2023). The existence of an adaptation finance gap \u2013 even under the maximum scenario \u2013 does imply that it is important to use adaptation finance effectively and to prioritize the allocation of international public finance, taking into account that private finance will gravitate towards profitable opportunities (see section 4.5.1), and that some countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change, among other factors. 61 Chapter 4 \u2013 Adaptation finance gap 2. 3. 4.7.3 Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T The Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T aims at scaling up climate finance to developing countries to support reducing greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development pathways, and implementing NDCs and NAPs, \u201cincluding through grants, concessional and non- debt-creating instruments, and measures to create fiscal space, taking into account relevant multilateral initiatives as appropriate.\u201d As the characteristics of the decision in Baku on the US$300 billion essentially mirror the decision in Copenhagen in 2009 (Pauw 2025), the need is high for the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T to think more outside of the box.

AGR 2025 recommends that progress can be made on three key issues: 1. Contain the growth of the gap. Mobilizing more adaptation finance will only be helpful to close the adaptation finance gap, if that gap stops growing. This could be advanced in two ways: \u25b6 \u25b6 Climate change mitigation needs to scale up by rapidly decreasing investments in fossil fuel assets (UNEP 2023c). The Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T could provide guidance on how to implement the UNFCCC global stocktake\u2019s call to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies (alongside other recommendations in the global stocktake\u2019s article 28). It could call on all Parties to, for example, reduce investments in fossil fuel infrastructure, and enact ambitious carbon pricing. The Roadmap could provide guidance on avoiding maladaptation. Built on imperfect information, many adaptation strategies fail, and can even create conditions that worsen the situation (Schipper 2020). In order to contain the growth of the adaptation finance gap, adaptation finance should not be wasted through maladaptation. The Roadmap could emphasize that successful adaptation should address the root causes of vulnerability, for example through fair allocation of finance within countries, enhancing access to resources, enhancing capabilities and opportunities, and addressing unequal power dynamics (Shawoo et al. 2025). It could also encourage locally led and GESI-integrative programming (see section 4.5) with concrete tracking, guidance and mechanisms, and even minimum allocation targets. Increase the volume of adaptation finance with the help of new climate finance providers. The Annex II list of climate finance contributors has not changed since its creation in 1992 (except for the removal of T\u00fcrkiye in 2001). This Annex II list is turning into a weakness of the UNFCCC in the context of a changing geopolitical world order, countries\u2019 diversifying emission and economic growth pathways; as well as increasing climate finance needs (Pauw et al. 2024). Adding countries to the Annex II list was not possible under the NCQG. In practice, however, many developing countries are already contributing significantly, and if such contributions were included, it significantly increases total international public adaptation finance by 27 per cent (see section 4.3). The Roadmap could identify ways in which those developing countries that are in a position to do so can contribute to closing the adaptation finance gap in ways that are more transparent and accountable than current South-South cooperation, but without formally adding such countries to the Annex II list of contributors.

The aim should be to increase the volume of adaptation finance with the help of new climate finance providers, without diluting existing responsibilities of developed countries. Engage the financial system more broadly. As well as increasing the amount of adaptation finance, it is imperative to integrate climate resilience in investment decisions in both public and private sectors. A draft negotiation text on the NCQG (\u201cstreamlined compilation of proposals\u201d) referred to relevant actors for this, including central banks, commercial banks, credit rating agencies and export credit agencies (UNFCCC 2024b). While the integration of physical climate risks into financial decision-making is less straightforward than for transition risks, their integration is critical to managing financial risks of climate change. Some central banks are starting to manage these risks.27 The insurance sector also needs to integrate physical risks in its policies (Mills 2009), and is increasingly 27 For example, the Reserve Bank of India carried out a survey in 2022 to assess the status of climate risk and sustainable finance among leading commercial banks (Reserve Bank of India 2022), and concluded that they need to fully grasp the physical risks associated with climate risk and actively start managing these to make their loan and investment portfolios more resilient. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand conducted a climate stress test to assess the financial impacts of climate-related risks on its largest banks\u2019 balance sheets. The banks themselves indicated that they could reduce their exposure to physical climate risks by, for example, changing to risk appetite settings, including by limiting new lending in flood-prone areas; repricing for climate-related risks such as adding climate risk premiums; and providing favourable loan terms for adaptation purposes such as flood defence. 62 Adaptation Gap Report 2025: Running on empty central to climate change adaptation efforts (Collier, Elliott and Lehtonen 2021).28 The integration of physical risks in financial decision-making might not necessarily mobilize additional investments in adaptation, but it will help to increase climate resilience over time. It must be reiterated (UNEP 2023a), however, that it could also negatively impact on the economies of developing countries in the short term, as addressing risks could increase prices, for example through insurance, guarantees or other de-risking instruments. In the worst case, the identification and integration of climate-related risks might led to investments being prohibitively expensive or unprofitable, and could even cause capital flight.

In the worst case, the identification and integration of climate-related risks might led to investments being prohibitively expensive or unprofitable, and could even cause capital flight. Advancing article 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement \u2013 if solely driven by financial materiality \u2013 might therefore lead to the increase of perceived risks and negative biases against the most vulnerable populations, including LDCs and SIDS (Moody\u2019s Investors Service 2017; Fitch Ratings 2021), or the most exposed sectors such as agriculture, natural capital and infrastructure. This is an issue of fairness that UNFCCC urgently needs to address (UNEP 2023a). 28 In the United States of America, insurance is growing more costly and less available for millions of Americans, especially for those in the most disaster- prone areas. Premiums paid by people living in places where climate-related losses were expected to be highest were on average 82 per cent higher than the premiums of people living in the least risky areas (Clark 2025). There is also evidence that mortgage providers integrate climate risks into their products. For example, although flood risk information is increasingly incorporated in the underwriting process in the United States of America, both hurricanes Harvey and Sandy led to elevated levels of commercial mortgage delinquency (Holtermans, Kahn and Kok 2024). 63 Chapter 4 \u2013 Adaptation finance gap References Chapter 1 Alc\u00e1ntara-Ayala, I.

33 4 Summary for Policymakers A: Introduction This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) presents key findings of the Working Group II (WGII) contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the IPCC1. The report builds on the WGII contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC, three Special Reports2, and the Working Group I (WGI) contribution to the AR6 cycle. This report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity3, and human societies (Figure SPM.1) and integrates knowledge more strongly across the natural, ecological, social and economic sciences than earlier IPCC assessments. The assessment of climate change impacts and risks as well as adaptation is set against concurrently unfolding non-climatic global trends e.g., biodiversity loss, overall unsustainable consumption of natural resources, land and ecosystem degradation, rapid urbanisation, human demographic shifts, social and economic inequalities and a pandemic. SPM The scientific evidence for each key finding is found in the 18 chapters of the underlying report and in the 7 cross-chapter papers as well as the integrated synthesis presented in the Technical Summary (hereafter TS) and referred to in curly brackets {}. Based on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of confidence using the IPCC calibrated language4. The WGII Global to Regional Atlas (Annex I) facilitates exploration of key synthesis findings across the WGII regions. The concept of risk is central to all three AR6 Working Groups. A risk framing and the concepts of adaptation, vulnerability, exposure, resilience, equity and justice, and transformation provide alternative, overlapping, complementary, and widely used entry points to the literature assessed in this WGII report. Across all three AR6 working groups, risk5 provides a framework for understanding the increasingly severe, interconnected and often irreversible impacts of climate change on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human systems; differing impacts across regions, sectors and communities; and how to best reduce adverse consequences for current and future generations. In the context of climate change, risk",

Across all three AR6 working groups, risk5 provides a framework for understanding the increasingly severe, interconnected and often irreversible impacts of climate change on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human systems; differing impacts across regions, sectors and communities; and how to best reduce adverse consequences for current and future generations. In the context of climate change, risk can arise from the dynamic interactions among climate-related hazards6 (see Working Group I), the exposure7 and vulnerability8 of affected human and ecological systems. The risk that can be introduced by human responses to climate change is a new aspect considered in the risk concept. This report identifies 127 key risks9. {1.3, 16.5} The vulnerability of exposed human and natural systems is a component of risk, but also, independently, an important focus in the literature. Approaches to analysing and assessing vulnerability have evolved since previous IPCC assessments. Vulnerability is widely understood to differ within communities and across societies, regions and countries, also changing through time. Adaptation10 plays a key role in reducing exposure and vulnerability to climate change. Adaptation in ecological systems includes autonomous adjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes. In human systems, adaptation can be anticipatory or reactive, as well as incremental 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Decision IPCC/XLVI-3, The assessment covers scientific literature accepted for publication by 1 September 2021. The three Special Reports are: \u2018Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C. An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5)\u2019; \u2018Climate Change and Land. An IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL)\u2019; \u2018IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC)\u2019. Biodiversity: Biodiversity or biological diversity means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, among other things, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems. Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99\u2013100% probability, very likely 90\u2013100%, likely 66\u2013100%, as likely as not 33\u201366%, unlikely 0\u201333%, very unlikely 0\u201310%, exceptionally unlikely 0\u20131%.

Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the other AR6 Reports. Risk is defined as the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems. Hazard is defined as the potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems and environmental resources. Physical climate conditions that may be associated with hazards are assessed in Working Group I as climatic impact-drivers. Exposure is defined as the presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected. Vulnerability in this report is defined as the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. Key risks have potentially severe adverse consequences for humans and social-ecological systems resulting from the interaction of climate related hazards with vulnerabilities of societies and systems exposed. 10 Adaptation is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in order to moderate harm or take advantage of beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate this. 5 Summary for Policymakers SPM s m e t s y s d e l p u o c s a y t e i c o s n a m u h d n a ) y t i s r e v i d o i b g n i d u l c n i ( s m e t s y s o c e , e t a m i l c : t n e m p o l e v e d t n e i l i s e r e t a m i l c o t k s i r e t a m i l c m o r F 6 e c n e i l i s e r h s i l b a t s e d n a s k s i r e t a m i l c e c u d e r o t s n o i t p",

The latter changes the fundamental attributes of a social-ecological system in anticipation of climate change and its impacts. Adaptation is subject to hard and soft limits11. Resilience12 in the literature has a wide range of meanings. Adaptation is often organized around resilience as bouncing back and returning to a previous state after a disturbance. More broadly the term describes not just the ability to maintain essential function, identity and structure, but also the capacity for transformation. SPM This report recognises the value of diverse forms of knowledge such as scientific, as well as Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in understanding and evaluating climate adaptation processes and actions to reduce risks from human-induced climate change. AR6 highlights adaptation solutions which are effective, feasible13, and conform to principles of justice14. The term climate justice, while used in different ways in different contexts by different communities, generally includes three principles: distributive justice which refers to the allocation of burdens and benefits among individuals, nations and generations; procedural justice which refers to who decides and participates in decision-making; and recognition which entails basic respect and robust engagement with and fair consideration of diverse cultures and perspectives. Effectiveness refers to the extent to which an action reduces vulnerability and climate-related risk, increases resilience, and avoids maladaptation15. This report has a particular focus on transformation16 and system transitions in energy; land, ocean, coastal and freshwater ecosystems; urban, rural and infrastructure; and industry and society. These transitions make possible the adaptation required for high levels of human health and well-being, economic and social resilience, ecosystem health17, and planetary health18 (Figure SPM.1). These system transitions are also important for achieving the low global warming levels (Working Group III) that would avoid many limits to adaptation11. The report also assesses economic and non-economic losses and damages19. This report labels the process of implementing mitigation and adaptation together in support of sustainable development for all as climate resilient development20.

This report labels the process of implementing mitigation and adaptation together in support of sustainable development for all as climate resilient development20. Box SPM.1 | AR6 Common Climate Dimensions, Global Warming Levels and Reference Periods Assessments of climate risks consider possible future climate change, societal development and responses. This report assesses literature including that based on climate model simulations that are part of the fifth and sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase (CMIP5, CMIP6) of the World Climate Research Programme. Future projections are driven by emissions and/or concentrations from illustrative Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)21 and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)22 scenarios, respectively23. Climate impacts literature is based primarily on climate projections assessed in AR5 or earlier, or assumed global warming levels, though some recent impacts literature uses newer projections based on the CMIP6 exercise. Given differences in the impacts literature regarding 11 Adaptation limits: The point at which an actor\u2019s objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions. Hard adaptation limit\u2014No adaptive actions are possible to avoid intolerable risks. Soft adaptation limit\u2014Options may exist but are currently not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action. 12 Resilience in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and ecosystems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure as well as biodiversity in case of ecosystems while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. Resilience is a positive attribute when it maintains such a capacity for adaptation, learning, and/or transformation. 13 Feasibility refers to the potential for an adaptation option to be implemented. 14 Justice is concerned with setting out the moral or legal principles of fairness and equity in the way people are treated, often based on the ethics and values of society. Social justice comprises just or fair relations within society that seek to address the distribution of wealth, access to resources, opportunity and support according to principles of justice and fairness. Climate justice comprises justice that links development and human rights to achieve a rights-based approach to addressing climate change. 15 Maladaptation refers to actions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability to climate change, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare, now or in the future. Most often, maladaptation is an unintended consequence. 16 Transformation refers to a change in the fundamental attributes of natural and human systems. 17 Ecosystem health: a metaphor used to describe the condition of an ecosystem, by analogy with human health.

Rather, the apparent health status of an ecosystem is judged on the ecosystem\u2019s resilience to change, with details depending upon which metrics (such as species richness and abundance) are employed in judging it and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment. 18 Planetary health: a concept based on the understanding that human health and human civilisation depend on ecosystem health and the wise stewardship of ecosystems. 19 In this report, the term \u2018losses and damages\u2019 refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. 20 In the WGII report, climate resilient development refers to the process of implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation measures to support sustainable development for all. 21 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where \u2018y\u2019 refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. 22 SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where \u2018SSPx\u2019 refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the scenarios, and \u2018y\u2019 refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. 23 IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions underlying the SSPs, which do not cover all possible scenarios. Alternative scenarios may be considered or developed. 7 Summary for Policymakers Box SPM.1 (continued) SPM socioeconomic details and assumptions, WGII chapters contextualize impacts with respect to exposure, vulnerability and adaptation as appropriate for their literature, this includes assessments regarding sustainable development and climate resilient development. There are many emissions and socioeconomic pathways that are consistent with a given global warming outcome. These represent a broad range of possibilities as available in the literature assessed that affect future climate change exposure and vulnerability. Where available, WGII also assesses literature that is based on an integrative SSP-RCP framework where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios are analysed against the backdrop of various illustrative SSPs22. The WGII assessment combines multiple lines of evidence including impacts modelling driven by climate projections, observations, and process understanding. {1.2, 16.5, 18.2, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 SPM.C, WGI AR6 Box SPM.1, WGI AR6 1.6, WGI AR6 12, AR5 WGI} A common set of reference years and time periods are adopted for assessing climate change and its impacts and risks: the reference period 1850\u20131900 approximates pre-industrial global surface temperature, and three future reference periods",

Robust geographical patterns of many variables can be identified at a given level of global warming, common to all scenarios considered and independent of timing when the global warming level is reached. {16.5, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 Box SPM.1, WGI AR6 4.2, WGI AR6 CCB11.1} WGI assessed the increase in global surface temperature is 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]24 \u00b0C in 2011\u20132020 above 1850\u20131900. The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003\u20132012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22] \u00b0C).25 Considering all five illustrative scenarios assessed by WGI, there is at least a greater than 50% likelihood that global warming will reach or exceed 1.5\u00b0C in the near-term, even for the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario26. { WGI AR6 SPM A1.2, WGI AR6 SPM B1.3, WGI AR6 Table SPM.1, WGI AR6 CCB 2.3} B: Observed and Projected Impacts and Risks Since AR5, the knowledge base on observed and projected impacts and risks generated by climate hazards, exposure and vulnerability has increased with impacts attributed to climate change and key risks identified across the report. Impacts and risks are expressed in terms of their damages, harms, economic, and non-economic losses. Risks from observed vulnerabilities and responses to climate change are highlighted. Risks are projected for the near-term (2021\u20132040), the mid (2041\u20132060) and long term (2081\u20132100), at different global warming levels and for pathways that overshoot 1.5\u00b0C global warming level for multiple decades27. Complex risks result from multiple climate hazards occurring concurrently, and from multiple risks interacting, compounding overall risk and resulting in risks transmitting through interconnected systems and across regions. 24 In the WGI report, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90% interval. 25 Since AR5, methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1\u00b0C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5. 26 Global warming of 1.5\u00b0C relative to 1850\u20131900 would be exceeded during the 21st century under",

Under the five illustrative scenarios, in the near term (2021\u20132040), the 1.5\u00b0C global warming level is very likely to be exceeded under the very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under the intermediate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0), more likely than not to be exceeded under the low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely than not to be reached under the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). Furthermore, for the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), it is more likely than not that global surface temperature would decline back to below 1.5\u00b0C toward the end of the 21st century, with a temporary overshoot of no more than 0.1\u00b0C above 1.5\u00b0C global warming. 27 Overshoot: In this report, pathways that first exceed a specified global warming level (usually 1.5\u00b0C, by more than 0.1\u00b0C), and then return to or below that level again before the end of a specified period of time (e.g., before 2100). Sometimes the magnitude and likelihood of the overshoot is also characterized. The overshoot duration can vary from at least one decade up to several decades. 8 Summary for Policymakers Observed Impacts from Climate Change B.1 Human-induced climate change, including more frequent and intense extreme events, has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people, beyond natural climate variability. Some development and adaptation efforts have reduced vulnerability. Across sectors and regions the most vulnerable people and systems are ob- served to be disproportionately affected. The rise in weather and climate extremes has led to some irreversible impacts as natural and human systems are pushed beyond their ability to adapt.

Globally, \u2018\u2013\u2019 denotes an overall adverse impact; \u2018Water scarcity\u2019 considers, e.g., water availability in general, groundwater, water quality, demand for water, drought in cities. Impacts on food production were assessed by excluding non-climatic drivers of production increases; Global assessment for agricultural production is based on the impacts on global aggregated production; \u2018Reduced animal and livestock health and productivity\u2019 considers, e.g., heat stress, diseases, productivity, mortality; \u2018Reduced fisheries yields and aquaculture production\u2019 includes marine and freshwater fisheries/production; \u2018Infectious diseases\u2019 include, e.g., water-borne and vector-borne diseases; \u2018Heat, malnutrition and other\u2019 considers, e.g., human heat-related morbidity and mortality, labour productivity, harm from wildfire, nutritional deficiencies; \u2018Mental health\u2019 includes impacts from extreme weather events, cumulative events, and vicarious or anticipatory events; \u2018Displacement\u2019 assessments refer to evidence of displacement attributable to climate and weather extremes; \u2018Inland flooding and associated damages\u2019 considers, e.g., river overflows, heavy rain, glacier outbursts, urban flooding; \u2018Flood/storm induced damages in coastal areas\u2019 include damages due to, e.g., cyclones, sea level rise, storm surges. Damages by key economic sectors are observed impacts related to an attributable mean or extreme climate hazard or directly attributed. Key economic sectors include standard classifications and sectors of importance to regions (for methodology and detailed references to chapters and cross-chapter papers see SMTS.1 and SMTS.1.2).

Challenges for water management will be exacerbated in the near, mid and long term, depending on the magnitude, rate and regional details of future climate change and will be particularly challenging for regions with constrained resources for water management (high confidence). {2.3, 4.4, 4.5, Box 4.2, Figure 4.20, 15.3, CCP5.3, CCB DISASTER, SROCC 2.3} Climate change will increasingly put pressure on food production and access, especially in vulnerable regions, undermining food security and nutrition (high confidence). Increases in frequency, intensity and severity of droughts, floods and heatwaves, and continued sea level rise will increase risks to food security (high confidence) in vulnerable regions from moderate to high between 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C global warming level, with no or low levels of adaptation (medium confidence). At 2\u00b0C or higher global warming level in the mid-term, food security risks due to climate change will be more severe, leading to malnutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Central and South America and Small Islands (high confidence). Global warming will progressively weaken soil health and ecosystem services such as pollination, increase pressure from pests and diseases, and reduce marine animal biomass, undermining food productivity in many regions on land and in the ocean (medium confidence). At 3\u00b0C or higher global warming level in the long term, areas exposed to climate-related hazards will expand substantially compared with 2\u00b0C or lower global warming level (high confidence), exacerbating regional disparity in food security risks (high confidence).

Globally, population exposure to heatwaves will continue to increase with additional warming, with strong geographical differences in heat-related mortality without additional adaptation (very high confidence). Climate-sensitive food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne disease risks are projected to increase under all levels of warming without additional adaptation (high confidence). In particular, dengue risk will increase with longer seasons and a wider geographic distribution in Asia, Europe, Central and South America and sub-Saharan Africa, potentially putting additional billions of people at risk by the end of the century (high confidence). Mental health challenges, including anxiety and stress, are expected to increase under further global warming in all assessed regions, particularly for children, adolescents, elderly, and those with underlying health conditions (very high confidence). {4.5, 5.12, Box 5.10, 7.3, Figure 7.9, 8.4, 9.10, Figure 9.32, Figure 9.35, 10.4,",

Globally, population change in low-lying cities and settlements will lead to approximately a billion people projected to be at risk from coastal-specific climate hazards in the mid-term under all scenarios, including in Small Islands (high confidence). The population potentially exposed to a 100-year coastal flood is projected to increase by about 20% if global mean sea level rises by 0.15 m relative to 2020 levels; this exposed population doubles at a 0.75 m rise in mean sea level and triples at 1.4 m without population change and additional adaptation (medium confidence). Sea level rise poses an existential threat for some Small Islands and some low-lying coasts (medium confidence). By 2100 the value of global assets within the future 1-in-100 year coastal floodplains is projected to be between US$7.9 and US$12.7 trillion (2011 value) under RCP4.5, rising to between US$8.8 and US$14.2 trillion under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). Costs for maintenance and reconstruction of urban infrastructure, including building, transportation, and energy will increase with global warming level (medium confidence), the associated functional disruptions are projected to be substantial particularly for cities, settlements and infrastructure located on permafrost in cold regions and on coasts (high confidence). {6.2, 9.9, 10.4, 13.6, 13.10, 15.3, 16.5, CCP2.1, CCP2.2, CCP5.3, CCP6.2, CCB SLR, SROCC 2.3, SROCC CCB9} Projected estimates of global aggregate net economic damages generally increase non-linearly with global warming levels (high confidence).35 The wide range of global estimates, and the lack of comparability between methodologies, does not allow for identification of a robust range of estimates (high confidence). The existence of higher estimates than assessed in AR5 indicates that global aggregate economic impacts could be higher than previous estimates (low confidence).36 Significant regional variation in aggregate economic damages from climate change is projected (high confidence) with estimated economic damages per capita for developing countries often higher as a fraction of income (high confidence).

At progressive levels of warming, involuntary migration from regions with high exposure and low adaptive capacity would occur (medium confidence). Compared to other socioeconomic factors the influence of climate on conflict is assessed as relatively weak (high confidence). Along long-term socioeconomic pathways that reduce non-climatic drivers, risk of violent conflict would decline (medium confidence). At higher global warming levels, impacts of weather and climate extremes, particularly drought, by increasing vulnerability will increasingly affect violent intrastate conflict (medium confidence). {TS B.7.4, 7.3, 16.5, CCB MIGRATE } 35 The assessment found estimated rates of increase in projected global economic damages that were both greater than linear and less than linear as global warming level increases.

(b) The Reasons for Concern (RFC) framework communicates scientific understanding about accrual of risk for five broad categories. Diagrams are shown for each RFC, assuming low to no adaptation (i.e., adaptation is fragmented, localized and comprises incremental adjustments to existing practices). However, the transition to a very high risk level has an emphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits. Undetectable risk level (white) indicates no associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change; moderate risk (yellow) indicates associated impacts are both detectable and attributable to climate change with at least medium confidence, also accounting for the other specific criteria for key risks; high risk (red) indicates severe and widespread impacts that are judged to be high on one or more criteria for assessing key risks; and very high risk level (purple) indicates very high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or the persistence of climate-related hazards, combined with limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the hazard or impacts/risks. The horizontal line denotes the present global warming of 1.09\u00b0C which is used to separate the observed, past impacts below the line from the future projected risks above it. RFC1: Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its Indigenous Peoples, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2: Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3: Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric, such as monetary damages, lives affected, species lost or ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused by global warming, such as ice sheet disintegration or thermohaline circulation slowing. Assessment methods are described in SM16.6 and are identical to AR5, but are enhanced by a structured approach to improve robustness and facilitate comparison between AR5 and AR6.

The assessed projections were based on a range of scenarios, including SRES, CMIP5, and ISIMIP, and, in some cases, demographic trends. The diagrams are truncated at the nearest whole \u00baC within the range of temperature change in 2100 under three SSP scenarios in panel (a). (f) Examples of regional key risks. Risks identified are of at least medium confidence level. Key risks are identified based on the magnitude of adverse consequences (pervasiveness of the consequences, degree of change, irreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries); likelihood of adverse consequences; temporal characteristics of the risk; and ability to respond to the risk, e.g., by adaptation. The full set of 127 assessed global and regional key risks is given in SM16.7. Diagrams are provided for some risks. The development of synthetic diagrams for Small Islands, Asia and Central and South America were limited by the availability of adequately downscaled climate projections, with uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic contexts across countries within a region, and the resulting low number of impact and risk projections for different warming levels. Absence of risks diagrams does not imply absence of risks within a region.

Depending on the mag- nitude and duration of overshoot, some impacts will cause release of additional greenhouse gases (medium confidence) and some will be irreversible, even if global warming is reduced (high confidence). (Box SPM.1, Figure SPM.3) {2.5, 3.4, 12.3, 16.6, CCB DEEP, CCB SLR} B.6.1 While model-based assessments of the impacts of overshoot pathways are limited, observations and current understanding of processes permit assessment of impacts from overshoot. Additional warming, e.g., above 1.5\u00b0C during an overshoot period this century, will result in irreversible impacts on certain ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted by ice-sheet, glacier melt, or by accelerating and higher committed sea level rise (high confidence).38 Risks to human systems will increase, including those to infrastructure, low-lying coastal settlements, some ecosystem-based adaptation measures, and associated livelihoods (high confidence), cultural and spiritual values (medium confidence). Projected impacts are less severe with shorter duration and lower levels of overshoot (medium confidence). {2.5, 3.4, 12.3, 13.2, 16.5, 16.6, CCP1.2, CCP2.2, CCP5.3, CCP6.1, CCP6.2, CCB SLR, WGI AR6 SPM B.5, WGI AR6 SPM C.3, SROCC 2.3, SROCC 5.4} 37 In this report, overshoot pathways exceed 1.5\u00b0C global warming and then return to that level, or below, after several decades. 38 Despite limited evidence specifically on the impacts of a temporary overshoot of 1.5\u00b0C, a much broader evidence base from process understanding and the impacts of higher global warming levels allows a high confidence statement on the irreversibility of some impacts that would be incurred following such an overshoot. 19 Summary for Policymakers B.6.2 Risk of severe impacts increase with every additional increment of global warming during overshoot (high confidence).

Many adaptation options exist and are used to help manage projected climate change impacts, but their implementation depends upon the capacity and effectiveness of governance and decision-making processes. These and other enabling conditions can also support climate resilient development (Section D). Current Adaptation and its Benefits C.1 C.1.1 C.1.2 Progress in adaptation planning and implementation has been observed across all sectors and regions, generating multiple benefits (very high confidence). However, adaptation progress is unevenly distributed with observed adaptation gaps40 (high confidence). Many initiatives prioritize immediate and near-term climate risk reduction which reduces the opportunity for transformational adaptation (high confidence). {2.6, 5.14, 7.4, 10.4, 12.5, 13.11, 14.7, 16.3, 17.3, CCP5.2, CCP5.4} Adaptation planning and implementation have continued to increase across all regions (very high confidence). Growing public and political awareness of climate impacts and risks has resulted in at least 170 countries and many cities including adaptation in their climate policies and planning processes (high confidence). Decision support tools and climate services are increasingly being used (very high confidence). Pilot projects and local experiments are being implemented in different sectors (high confidence). Adaptation can generate multiple additional benefits such as improving agricultural productivity, innovation, health and well-being, food security, livelihood, and biodiversity conservation as well as reduction of risks and damages (very high confidence). {1.4, 2.6, 3.5, 3.6, 4.7, 4.8, 5.4, 5.6, 5.10, 6.4, 7.4, 8.5, 9.3, 9.6, 10.4, 12.5, 13.11, 15.5, 16.3, 17.2, 17.3, 17.5, CCP5.4, CCB ADAPT, CCB NATURAL} Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist between current levels of adaptation and levels needed to respond to impacts and reduce climate risks (high confidence).

However, recent climate change has shifted some systems in some regions from being net carbon sinks to net carbon sources. 40 Adaptation gaps are defined as the difference between actually implemented adaptation and a societally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to tolerated climate change impacts and reflecting resource limitations and competing priorities. 20 Summary for Policymakers Future Adaptation Options and their Feasibility C.2 There are feasible41 and effective42 adaptation options which can reduce risks to people and nature. The feasibility of implementing adaptation options in the near-term differs across sectors and regions (very high confidence). The effec- tiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk is documented for specific contexts, sectors and regions (high confidence) and will decrease with increasing warming (high confidence). Integrated, multi-sectoral solutions that address social in- equities, differentiate responses based on climate risk and cut across systems, increase the feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation in multiple sectors (high confidence).

Feasibility depends on geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional factors that enable or constrain the implementation of an option. The feasibility of options may change when different options are combined and increase when enabling conditions are strengthened. 42 Effectiveness refers to the extent to which an adaptation option is anticipated or observed to reduce climate-related risk. 43 In this report, the term natural forests describes those which are subject to little or no direct human intervention, whereas the term managed forests describes those where planting or other management activities take place, including those managed for commodity production. 21 Summary for Policymakers SPM y t i l i b i s a e f l a i t n e t o p f o s n o i s n e m D i n o i t a g i t i m h t i w s e i g r e n y s d n a l e v e l y t i l i b i s a e F - o e G l a c i s y h p - n o r i v n E l a t n e m l a i c o S - i t s n I l a n o i t u t - o n h c e T l a c i g o l c i m o n o c E n o i t a g i t i m y t i l i b i s a e f s n o i t p o n o i t a t p a d a d n a s e i g r e n y S h t i w l a i t n e t o P 1 s e s n o p s e r e t a",

The resilience of species, biological communities and ecosystem processes increases with size of natural area, by restoration of degraded areas and by reducing non-climatic stressors (high confidence). To be effective, conservation and restoration actions will increasingly need to be responsive, as appropriate, to ongoing changes at various scales, and plan for future changes in ecosystem structure, community composition and species\u2019 distributions, especially as 1.5\u00b0C global warming is approached and even more so if it is exceeded (high confidence). Adaptation options, where circumstances allow, include facilitating the movement of species to new ecologically appropriate locations, particularly through increasing connectivity between conserved or protected areas, targeted intensive management for vulnerable species and protecting refugial areas where species can survive locally (medium confidence). {2.3, 2,6, Figure 2.1, Table 2.6, 3.3, 3.6, Box 3.4, 4.6, Box 4.6, Box 11.2, 12.3, 12.5, 13.4, 14.7, CCP5.4, CCB FEASIB} Effective Ecosystem-based Adaptation44 reduces a range of climate change risks to people, biodiversity and ecosystem services with multiple co-benefits (high confidence). Ecosystem-based Adaptation is vulnerable to climate change impacts, with effectiveness declining with increasing global warming (high confidence). Urban greening using trees and other vegetation can provide local cooling (very high confidence). Natural river systems, wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems reduce flood risk by storing water and slowing water flow, in most circumstances (high confidence).

Inclusive, integrated and long-term planning at local, municipal, sub-national and national scales, together with effective regulation and monitoring systems and financial and technological resources and capabilities foster urban and rural system transition (high confidence). Effective partnerships between governments, civil society, and private sector organizations, across scales provide infrastructure and services in ways that enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable people (medium to high confidence). {5.12, 5.13, 5.14, 6.3, 6.4, Box 6.3, Box 6.6, Table 6.6, 7.4, 12.5, 13.6, 14.5, Box 14.4, Box 17.4, CCP2.3, CCP2.4, CCP5.4, CCB FEASIB} An increasing number of adaptation responses exist for urban systems, but their feasibility and effectiveness is constrained by institutional, financial, and technological access and capacity, and depends on coordinated and contextually appropriate responses across physical, natural and social infrastructure (high confidence). Globally, more financing is directed at physical infrastructure than natural and social infrastructure (medium confidence) and there is limited evidence of investment in the informal settlements hosting the most vulnerable urban residents (medium to high confidence).

Such adaptation challenges would occur much earlier under high rates of sea level rise, in particular if low-likelihood, high impact outcomes associated with collapsing ice sheets occur (high confidence). Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence in low-lying coastal cities and settlements and small islands include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation (high confidence)45. These responses are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, aligned with sociocultural values and development priorities, and underpinned by inclusive community engagement processes (high confidence). { 6.2, 10.4, 11.7, Box 11.6, 13.2, 14.5, 15.5, CCP2.3, CCB SLR, WGI AR6 SPM B.5, WGI AR6 SPM C.3, SROCC SPM C3.2} SPM Approximately 3.4 billion people globally live in rural areas around the world, and many are highly vulnerable to climate change. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works programmes, is highly feasible and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure. Social safety nets are increasingly being reconfigured to build adaptive capacities of the most vulnerable in rural and also urban communities. Social safety nets that support climate change adaptation have strong co-benefits with development goals such as education, poverty alleviation, gender inclusion and food security.

For example, seawalls effectively reduce impacts to people and assets in the short-term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate risks in the long-term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan (high confidence). Adaptation integrated with development reduces lock-ins and creates opportunities (e.g., infrastructure upgrading) (medium confidence). {1.4, 3.4, 3.6, 10.4, 11.7, Box 11.6, 13.2, 17.2, 17.5, 17.6, CCP 2.3, CCB DEEP, CCB SLR} Biodiversity and ecosystem resilience to climate change are decreased by maladaptive actions, which also constrain ecosystem services. Examples of these maladaptive actions for ecosystems include fire suppression in naturally fire-adapted ecosystems or hard defences against flooding. These actions reduce space for natural processes and represent a severe form of maladaptation for the ecosystems they degrade, replace or fragment, thereby reducing their resilience to climate change and the ability to provide ecosystem services for adaptation.

Multiple climate resilient development pathways are still possible by which communities, the private sector, governments, nations and the world can pursue climate resilient development \u2013 each involving and resulting from different societal choices influenced by different contexts and opportunities and constraints on system transitions. Climate resilient development pathways are progressively constrained by every increment of warming, in particular beyond 1.5\u00b0C, social and economic inequalities, the balance between adaptation and mitigation varying by national, regional and local circumstances and geographies, according to capabilities including resources, vulnerability, culture and values, past development choices leading to past emissions and future warming scenarios, bounding the climate resilient development pathways remaining, and the ways in which development trajectories are shaped by equity, and social and climate justice.

Climate resilient devel- opment is facilitated by international cooperation and by governments at all levels working with communities, civil society, educational bodies, scientific and other institutions, media, investors and businesses; and by developing partner- ships with traditionally marginalised groups, including women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, local communities and ethnic minorities (high confidence). These partnerships are most effective when supported by enabling political leadership, institutions, resources, including finance, as well as climate services, information and decision support tools (high confi- dence).

Panel (a) Societal choices towards higher CRD (green cog) or lower CRD (red cog) result from interacting decisions and actions by diverse government, private sector and civil society actors, in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps. These actors engage with adaptation, mitigation and development actions in political, economic and financial, ecological, socio-cultural, knowledge and technology, and community arenas from local to international levels. Opportunities for climate resilient development are not equitably distributed around the world. Panel (b) Cumulatively, societal choices, which are made continuously, shift global development pathways towards higher (green) or lower (red) climate resilient development. Past conditions (past emissions, climate change and development) have already eliminated some development pathways towards higher CRD (dashed green line). SPM Panel (c) Higher CRD is characterised by outcomes that advance sustainable development for all. Climate resilient development is progressively harder to achieve with global warming levels beyond 1.5\u00b0C.

NASA uses the vantage point of space and its expertise in aeronautics to innovate, inform, and inspire for the benefit of all. NASA is a leader and trusted partner in providing climate and Earth system observations, modeling, research, applications, technology, and actionable information to scientists, decision- makers, and the public. NASA\u2019s free and open data powers research across the federal government, academia, and the private sector. The agency also works alongside international, federal, state, and local partners to advance understanding of and response to our changing planet. NASA\u2019s climate portfolio is varied, extensive, and covers multiple missions and focus areas. To help assess and advance NASA\u2019s climate strategy, a Climate Strategy Working Group (CSWG) was created and now falls under the guidance of the Office of the Chief Scientist. The CSWG found: \u2022 With more than two dozen satellites and instruments observing key climate indicators, NASA, in coordination with its domestic and international partners, remains the world\u2019s leading agency for observing and understanding changes to the Earth system; \u2022 NASA has decades of experience developing technologies that contribute to reducing emissions and enhancing sustainability; and \u2022 NASA delivers climate-related information and resources to a wide range of government and university partners as well as the public. The breadth of NASA\u2019s climate efforts presents challenges in, and opportunities for, intra-agency coordination. In addition, there are many other governmental and non-governmental entities engaged in climate-related research and technology development that present partnering opportunities and a need to clearly articulate NASA\u2019s role. There is also a need to continue to improve the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of NASA\u2019s climate information and technology. Finally, climate is changing, which impacts research needs and our own operations (including mission safety and timely attainment of milestones). To address these challenges and achieve our climate mission, the CSWG identified four major priorities and several needs within each priority. These priorities are to innovate, inform, inspire, and partner. Advancing NASA\u2019s Climate Strategy | 2 Priorities Priority 1 INNOVATE Priority 2 INFORM Priority 3 INSPIRE Priority 4 PARTNER 1.1.

Status and Challenges The inventory of current activities reveals an impressive array of efforts across the agency, demonstrating how NASA is paving the way on many aspects of climate- related research and applications (see box above). To support this strategy, the CSWG assessed the status of NASA\u2019s climate portfolio and found: \u2022 With more than two dozen satellites and instruments observing key climate indicators, and with the upcoming Earth System Observatory (ESO), NASA, in coordination with its domestic and international partners, remains the world\u2019s leading agency for observing and understanding changes to the Earth system; Advancing NASA\u2019s Climate Strategy | 10 NASA NASA\u2019s Climate Portfolio \u2022 NASA has decades of experience developing technologies that contribute to reducing emissions and enhancing sustainability; and \u2022 NASA delivers climate-related information and resources to a wide range of government and university partners as well as the public. In assessing the efficacy and impact of the agency\u2019s current activities, the CSWG identified several challenges that this strategy aims to address: \u2022 Climate change involves or touches almost the entire agency, including every mission directorate. Agency activities go beyond climate research to significant investment in climate-related technology in aeronautics, clean energy, environmental monitoring, and applications. Furthermore, the agency has key infrastructure at risk from climate change and has begun to consider GHG emissions and climate in its planning and sustainability processes. This breadth presents challenges in, and opportunities for, intra-agency coordination; \u2022 There are many other governmental and non-governmental actors engaged in climate-related research and technology development that present partnering opportunities and a need to clearly articulate NASA\u2019s role in climate; \u2022 There is a need to continue to improve the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of NASA\u2019s climate information and technology; and \u2022 Climate is changing, which impacts research needs and NASA\u2019s operations (including mission safety and timely attainment of milestones).

NASA\u2019s free and open data powers research across the federal government, academia, and the private sector. The agency also works alongside international, federal, state, tribal and local partners to advance understanding of and response to our changing planet. Priority 1 INNOVATE 1.1: Advance climate and Earth science through the initiation of novel observations, including the Earth System Observatory, associated research and modeling, and the creation of societally useful applications. NASA is a world leader in observing and understanding the Earth system. NASA\u2019s existing satellite and instrument fleet provides measurements of changes in vegetation, carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s energy budget, clouds and precipitation, the mass of ice sheets, oceans, and much more that are integral to our current understanding of the Earth\u2019s climate. NASA integrates these observations into scientific discovery and models to provide a more complete picture of the Earth system and its changes. NASA\u2019s observations, models, and research are global in scope and integrate both human-induced and naturally-occurring changes to the Earth system. NASA\u2019s contributions to Earth observations and modeling have fundamentally improved our understanding of climate and the Earth system. Advancing NASA\u2019s Climate Strategy | 15 Priorities and Needs There are still many questions and uncertainties remaining that require new and innovative observations to answer. Some of these questions have been identified in the National Academies Earth Science Decadal Survey, while others emerge from broader initiatives and scientific efforts. To help address these questions and continue the agency\u2019s leadership in observing and understanding the Earth system, there is a need to continue to provide innovative observations, applications, and associated modeling. As part of that effort, NASA will be developing and launching the ESO. The ESO suite of satellites will be designed to complement each other, working in tandem to create a three-dimensional, holistic view of Earth. In addition, there is a need to consider new technology, architectures, and partnerships for climate-relevant missions to spur new science and applications capabilities that increase societal value. While most of the Earth observation and modeling efforts reside in NASA\u2019s ESD, there are many opportunities for cross-NASA engagement and innovation. Technologies and sensors developed for other missions could help improve our ability to observe the Earth, just like the sensors used in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) informed development of the sensors used in the OCO missions.

To help spur innovation in Earth observation and modeling, there is a need to facilitate engagement between ESD, other parts of SMD, and STMD (see also 4.3). In the post-ISS era, commercial low-Earth orbit (LEO) destinations could have the capability to host Earth observing instruments. The Commercial LEO Development Program under SOMD is working with SMD/ESD and HPD to identify and integrate their future needs for these next generation platforms. Continued collaboration between SMD and SOMD is needed to ensure a smooth transition post-ISS. An illustration of NISAR, the pathfinder mission of NASA\u2019s Earth System Observatory. Advancing NASA\u2019s Climate Strategy | 16 NASA Priorities and Needs 1.2: Advance the development and use of aeronautics and space technologies that enable us to understand, mitigate, and adapt to climate change. NASA has a long history of advancing the state of the art in several technology areas critical to U.S. leadership in aviation, science, and exploration. NASA\u2019s current climate and clean energy technology investments are spread across multiple mission directorates, in several technology focus areas, including: \u2022 GHG emissions mitigation and reduction; \u2022 Clean energy (production, distribution, conversion, management, storage, transmission, etc.); \u2022 Sustainable aviation; \u2022 New observation paradigms, technologies for observation platforms, and instruments for climate relevant science; and \u2022 New approaches for application, fusion, and integration of relevant data and technologies. NASA\u2019s approach to technology development for climate-related challenges must be strategic to focus on the most critical challenges, leverage limited resources to have the greatest impact, and avoid duplication. There is a need to increase coordination and cross- directorate efforts to address climate technology investments (see also 4.3). The mission directorates could incorporate climate and clean energy priorities into the agency\u2019s strategic technology (STAR) framework to prioritize technology gaps and future investments. There is a need to use the full set of tools at its disposal to develop technology, including, but not limited to, leveraging Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer programs to engage small businesses and entrepreneurs, using grants to support early-stage research at universities, and public challenges and prize competitions to engage innovators across the globe. Cross-directorate coordination should prioritize the transition and infusion of new and innovative technologies with clear pathways for new technology inclusion in flight hardware and missions. This is particularly relevant as new technologies and architectures can spur new capabilities in science and application value including, for example, visualization and decision support. For example, the FireSense working group leverages",

NASA also recognizes that in some technology areas the innovation is happening outside the walls of government, such as in small businesses and venture-backed companies. Capabilities in artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and autonomy are advancing quickly in response to market demands. There is also a need to engage with the entrepreneurial community, and the funders that support them (see also 4.2), that are developing solutions with an eye towards sustainable commercial space and aeronautics markets. Advancing a culture that embraces risk and experimentation, advancing technology not only for new capabilities but also for national advantage, is paramount to NASA\u2019s ability to support the space economy and combat the climate crisis.

NASA has developed and improved numerous technologies that could have applications on Earth for reducing emissions, increasing energy efficiency, and enhancing sustainability. For example, to support astronauts living on the ISS and in research for space exploration missions, NASA has developed and improved several technologies that have applications on Earth, such as water processing, oxygen recovery from carbon dioxide, and crop and other food production technologies. The ISS National Lab is also sponsoring initiatives in partnership with commercial companies, with a goal of advancing sustainability research, such as addressing the problem of plastic waste and enabling scientific and technological advances that improve Earth\u2019s environment. NASA\u2019s investments are also resulting in technologies that have sustainability impacts in space and on Earth, including sustainable food production and clean power and propulsion, such as solar.

NASA\u2019s investments are also resulting in technologies that have sustainability impacts in space and on Earth, including sustainable food production and clean power and propulsion, such as solar. NASA has a long history of promoting the transfer of NASA-developed technologies into non-NASA applications for public benefit, including for climate and sustainability. Spinoffs include sustainable farming methods that increase crop yield with fewer resources, clean energy production, and tools or technologies that provide risk assessment models or other capabilities to address flooding and other climate-related natural disasters. There is a need to continue to promote Earth applications of technologies developed for exploration by identifying and protecting NASA\u2019s intellectual property and marketing and licensing NASA\u2019s patent portfolio to create commercial products to benefit the nation. There is also a need to continue to promote startup company formation to leverage NASA\u2019s technology investments, making NASA-developed software available to industry, entrepreneurs, academia, and the public. 1.4: Ensure sustainability of NASA centers and facilities, including reducing agency GHG emissions and increasing resiliency to climate variability and change. Climate change will have significant impacts on NASA\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission. NASA has made it mandatory to integrate climate considerations into the agency\u2019s policies, strategies, master plans, and partner engagements. At the same time, NASA, like all businesses and agencies, is a source of GHG emissions. Recognizing both the importance of proactively addressing climate change and risks to mission due to climate change, and in compliance with E.O. 14008, NASA prepared a Climate Action Plan to provide NASA\u2019s vision for adapting to climate change effects on its mission, facilities, infrastructure, natural lands, and other assets, now and in the future. NASA also has an ongoing effort, the Climate Adaptation Science Investigators (CASI) working group, that provides updated climate science and information for use in planning and risk analysis at NASA centers. NASA has also tracked agency GHG emissions since 2008 and has seen a consistent downward trend in emissions. Advancing NASA\u2019s Climate Strategy | 18 ESA/Alexander Gers Priorities and Needs Priority 2 INFORM Earth observation satellite Landsat 9 While NASA has incorporated climate considerations into agency planning and reduced agency emissions over time, continued work is needed to address continued climate change. Thus, there is a need to ensure the sustainability of its missions, centers, and facilities. There is also a need to periodically review existing efforts to integrate climate adaptation risks and mitigation planning into NASA risk management and budget development processes to ensure they reflect the latest knowledge on climate change. There is also a need to identify and implement specific actions to further reduce the agency\u2019s carbon footprint, in line with E.O. 14057. NASA facilities are managed by OSI. However, the information and tools developed by ESD can be used to support this analysis.

Through the NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs), the NASA Earth Science Data Systems Program, and the NASA Applied Sciences Program, NASA has demonstrated international leadership in providing free public access to climate and Earth science information. NASA has continued to innovate in the use of open data services and cloud-based data archives and processing systems. NASA has made important progress in using tools to catalogue and organize Earth science datasets to improve discoverability and accessibility for the Earth science community. While NASA\u2019s climate and Earth science information is publicly available, there are still barriers to its use and a need to increase discoverability, accessibility, and usability of this information. Recent advances in cloud computing, powerful browser-based visualization tools, and the growing adoption of a common open data service specification (OpenAPI) provide opportunities to increase broad access to NASA climate and Earth science information, following Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse (FAIR) data access principles. However, further work is needed to organize this information into coherent, actionable information products for specific climate change planning and response activities for diverse user and stakeholder communities. In addition, these efforts, in coordination with other federal agencies, need to consider the importance of ensuring the long-term continuity and reliability of information products and data services that support climate change planning and response. A further challenge is that many potential users do not have access to sufficient computing resources to process and use the large volumes of data generated by NASA missions. NASA has been moving data into the cloud to facilitate its use by a broad user community and has identified climate data accessibility as a priority in its recent Equity Action Plan, with plans to move more data into the cloud Advancing NASA\u2019s Climate Strategy | 19 NASA Priorities and Needs (see also 2.3). There is a need to manage climate and Earth science datasets using both cloud-based and dedicated compute infrastructure.

NASA has supported the use of climate insights from Earth science to benefit the economy, health, quality of life, and environment. These activities include project and program-level collaborations with local, state, and tribal governmental and non-governmental organizations to develop and demonstrate the use of Earth observation data for climate-related decision making. NASA also supports efforts to enhance the capacity of these organizations to use Earth observation data. Internationally, NASA makes important contributions to national climate change information repositories and visualization tools developed for the public. Activities such as the NASA-U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) SERVIR program have also established a pathway for increasing use of NASA data by international partners to improve capacity to respond to natural disasters and manage natural resources in the face of climate change. Various NASA activities, such as the NASA Sea Level Projection Tool, the NASA FIRMS, and OpenET, demonstrate how NASA data can be integrated into both long-term climate change planning and short-term response to the emerging impacts of climate change, such as intensifying wildfire events, increasing drought severity and duration, and declines in streamflow. NASA capabilities such as the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division and NASA Earth Exchange, based at Ames Research Center, and the Participants of NASA\u2019s Student Airborne Science Activation inaugural class and some of their mentors pose in front of NASA\u2019s P-3 aircraft, which they used to collect Earth science data needed for their research studies.

Nearly all upcoming Earth observing satellite missions enable key opportunities to provide new information to support climate response planning. The 2018 National Academies\u2019 Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space highlights the importance of utilizing data from these satellite missions to both support advances in scientific understanding and to improve our collective ability to respond to climate change. There is a need to continue to enhance information, tools, applications, and resources that support efforts by communities and stakeholders in preparing for and responding to climate change. Such efforts could include providing climate change data and information, as well as efforts to engage communities in co-developing resources. The newly announced Earth Information Center provides an opportunity to do both. 2.3: Address climate change impacts in underserved and vulnerable communities by promoting equity in the collection and use of climate and Earth science information. NASA\u2019s climate data is used by many researchers and stakeholders. However, for historical and cultural reasons, many communities and organizations have not had equitable and sufficient resources to fully leverage NASA capabilities. In addition, using NASA data and tools can require large computing resources and significant technical knowledge, which can present challenges for many people and communities. NASA\u2019s existing efforts on transforming to open science aim to ensure tools and resources are open and accessible. In addition, NASA\u2019s Equity Action Plan includes an effort to move some Earth science data to the cloud and provide trainings in Spanish language to improve equity and accessibility of Earth science information. While NASA has initiated efforts to advance equity and accessibility of climate and Earth science information, there are still barriers to its use. There is a need to promote equity and environmental justice in the collection and use of climate information. Such efforts could include: \u2022 Developing information, resources, and tools to help under-resourced organizations evaluate their climate risks (see also 2.2); \u2022 Increasing the accessibility of climate information provided (see also 2.1); and \u2022 Partnering with organizations working in communities most impacted by climate change and identify ways in which NASA can contribute towards environmental and climate justice initiatives (see also 4.2).

NASA has a broad portfolio of climate research and climate-related technology development. NASA\u2019s brand provides a powerful pull for other agencies to partner with NASA on these projects to capture the imagination of the public and seek their involvement. Yet, many are not aware of or have incomplete knowledge of NASA\u2019s climate activities. NASA\u2019s Global Climate Change website, climate.nasa.gov, is the top-rated website in the world for users searching for \u201cclimate change.\u201d However, thus far, it has focused predominantly on NASA\u2019s Earth science research. Information on climate-related technology development at NASA is sprinkled throughout other NASA websites and does not have a consolidated home online. While many are aware of a few aspects of NASA\u2019s climate portfolio, few are aware of the breadth of the Earth and climate-related research and technology development at NASA. To help researchers and the public understand and address climate change, there is a need to improve stakeholder and public awareness of the full extent of the agency\u2019s climate portfolio. Communication products should be designed to engage a broad audience through different media and platforms (e.g., print, social media, podcasts, videos, etc.), with messages designed to showcase NASA\u2019s full climate portfolio. In addition, developing a single website for all of NASA\u2019s climate-related activities, encompassing the agency\u2019s entire climate portfolio, could help facilitate these efforts. While the Office of Communications leads all communications efforts for NASA, much of the work is accomplished through mission directorate and center communication strategies and teams. There is opportunity to improve coordination among these organizations to ensure a consistent and impactful voice and messaging strategy. 3.2: Enhance and support climate literacy of the NASA workforce and those who work with NASA. Climate variability and climate change impact all NASA centers and therefore NASA\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission. Recent Executive Orders related to climate (e.g., E.O. 14008 and E.O. 14057) provide direction to NASA with respect to the agency\u2019s climate actions. NASA\u2019s climate portfolio will involve a broad swath of the agency\u2019s workforce beyond traditional climate scientists, including those in mission support organizations, technical mission directorates, and centers. Many of those involved in these activities have limited training in or awareness of climate change, or of the extent of the agency\u2019s climate activities. There is a need to enhance and support climate literacy within the agency\u2019s workforce. Such climate literacy efforts would provide resources for NASA employees to learn and understand climate change and how it impacts NASA\u2019s mission, the vulnerability of NASA centers and facilities, and what NASA is doing in response to climate change.",

A variety of means could be used to enhance and support climate literacy, including webinars, trainings, and surveys. Advancing NASA\u2019s Climate Strategy | 22 Priorities and Needs NASA\u2019s SpaceX Crew-2 NASA astronaut Megan McArthur speaks to students during a visit to Arlington Science Focus Elementary School, Friday, June 10, 2022, in Arlington, Virginia. There are several existing efforts within NASA to provide education and training materials related to climate, including resources for K-12 students and educators (e.g., the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program), training material on NASA\u2019s Earth Science data and applications (e.g., the Applied Remote SEnsing Training Program, or ARSET), and projects connecting climate scientists to mission support organizations who need climate information (e.g., CASI). In addition, climate literacy efforts are also being pursued by other federal agencies as part of their climate action plans. NASA\u2019s climate literacy efforts could bring together information and insights from ESD, OSTEM, and other federal agencies (where appropriate). 3.3: Inspire and educate the next generation of climate researchers and citizens. NASA has a wide variety of activities designed to inspire and educate researchers and the public, including public prize competitions, challenges, crowdsourcing, and citizen science activities, many of which relate to climate. These activities are designed for all ages, and include resources for K-12 students and educators, research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and science education activities for the public. While existing efforts have had a broad reach, there remains a need to continue to inspire and educate the next generation of climate researchers and citizens, including across all demographic and socioeconomic groups. These efforts could include expanding STEM and public engagement products, and opportunities to learn about climate and NASA\u2019s portfolio; adding a climate focus to more agency- supported STEM programs; creating additional climate-related materials to be used by teachers/educators; and integrating STEM activities into major climate science and technology agency initiatives.

NASA is one of many federal agencies conducting climate-related research. NASA currently participates in a broad range of federal interagency working groups (e.g., USGCRP). These groups span a broad range of activities, including observations, climate research, and meteorological services, as well as specific topics, including the ocean, the Arctic, and resilience. NASA also works with other federal agencies in bilateral and multilateral efforts, including partnerships on satellite missions (e.g., with USGS for Landsat) and projects (e.g., with USAID on SERVIR). NASA\u2019s observations and research are global in scope. NASA works with international partners, including participating in international working groups (e.g., the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites and the Group on Earth Observations), partnering on satellite missions (e.g., with DLR/GFZ on GRACE/GRACE-FO), and co-developing information dissemination portals (e.g., with JAXA and ESA on the Earth Observing Dashboard). NASA scientists also contribute to a variety of national and international assessments, including the IPCC and the National Climate Assessment. NASA also works with state, local, and tribal governments in understanding and responding to climate change. While there are many existing collaboration and coordination efforts, strategic sustained and enhanced collaboration is needed to ensure the broadest applicability and use of NASA climate information and technologies. NASA\u2019s climate research is complementary to the efforts at other agencies. Furthermore, each agency has its own set of stakeholders and user groups. Continued and enhanced coordination and collaboration with other agencies is needed to meet user needs, ensure a broader reach of all U.S. Government climate information, and provide sustained and innovative observations and information. Similarly, continued collaboration with international partners is needed to provide sustained and innovative observations and information. Since most NASA missions are not planned with successors, balancing the extended operations of NASA missions, planning for new missions that continue the records of current observables, and coordination with other federal agencies and international partners, are all needed to address continuity of data and information products. Finally, as climate changes, the needs of users and researchers for climate information and technology will also change. Such changes may necessitate evolving contributions to existing interagency and international efforts, or engagement with additional interagency and international activities to complement existing efforts.

There are an increasing number of commercial and not-for-profit entities engaging in Earth observations, climate research, and climate-related technology development. NASA has been introducing commercial small satellite capability into its programs through the purchase of data via the Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition program. This program provides access to commercial satellite data for scientific use by NASA-funded researchers (and other federal partners in some instances). NASA also has collaborations with non-profits and commercial entities for climate research, including projects, partnerships, consortia, and Space Act agreements. For example, NASA Harvest is a consortium of actors, including public, private, and universities, focused on using satellite information for agricultural applications. For space technology and aviation, NASA is heavily invested in cost-sharing partnerships and collaborative research with U.S. industry to research and demonstrate technology advancements. For example, NASA worked with Electric Power Systems to design and develop the batteries for the X-57 experimental electric flight plane. Additionally, NASA\u2019s University Leadership Initiative supports universities pioneering next-generation technologies for a net-zero carbon emissions aviation future. While NASA has several successful engagements with commercial and not-for- profit entities, there continue to be new entities and new products emerging. There is a need to expand ongoing successful partnerships and the community NASA engages with on climate. There is also a need to identify new opportunities for collaboration and consider when and how NASA engages with new entities. The opportunities for partnership span many mission directorates and centers. For example, SMD runs the Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition program and engages in research and application partnerships. ARMD works closely with industry on aviation research and technology demonstrations. STMD works closely with industry and academia on space technology research and technology demonstrations and the commercialization of those inventions through NASA\u2019s technology transfer program. To enhance the engagement with these commercial and not-for-profit entities, NASA could facilitate closer coordination among mission directorates (including mission support) and centers to explore these opportunities. 4.3: Increase coordination and collaboration among NASA centers and mission directorates with respect to climate research and climate-related technology development. NASA\u2019s climate research and climate-related technology development spans the agency, with involvement from all mission directorates and centers.

Therefore, research into monitoring and understanding that change, developing necessary technologies, and responding to climate change, will all be more impactful through greater integration and enhanced collaboration across the agency. To facilitate that integration and collaboration, NASA could consider organizing and facilitating periodic focused climate summits to share information about NASA\u2019s climate portfolio with others in the agency, identify opportunities for potential future collaborative activities, and identify opportunities for more targeted discussions on intra-agency collaborations on climate. Since climate research and climate-related technology development are spread throughout the agency, there are many opportunities for collaborations between the mission directorates and centers. NASA could consider maintaining a small working group under the Office of the Chief Scientist and Senior Climate Advisor, bringing together representatives from all mission directorates and centers to discuss, inform, and advise on potential climate-related initiatives across the agency.

Executive summary 1. Ten years on from the adoption of the Paris Agreement, this 2025 NDC synthesis report provides new indications of real and increasing progress on action to address climate change through national efforts underpinned by global cooperation. In their NDCs, Parties are setting out new national climate targets, and plans to achieve them, that differ in pace and scale to any that have come before. According to their NDCs, Parties are bending their combined emission curve further downward, but still not quickly enough. The whole-of- economy, whole-of-society approaches evident in NDCs point to strong climate action as an increasingly core pillar of ensuring economic stability and growth, jobs, health, and energy security and affordability, among many other policy imperatives, in countries. However, it remains clear that major acceleration is still needed in terms of delivering faster and deeper emission reductions and ensuring that the vast benefits of strong climate action reach all countries and peoples. This report provides valuable new insights, albeit limited in scope, on the basis of the 64 new NDCs submitted by 64 Parties to the Paris Agreement and recorded in the NDC registry between 1 January 2024 and 30 September 2025, covering about 30 per cent of total global emissions in 2019. It is not possible to draw wide-ranging global-level conclusions or inferences from this limited data set. Nevertheless, the report highlights many key lessons, about progress being made and major challenges ahead, emerging from the NDCs synthesized: (a) The new NDCs show a progression in terms of quality, credibility and economic coverage, with 89 per cent of Parties communicating economy-wide targets (compared with 81 per cent in their previous NDCs); (b) The new NDCs include responses to the outcomes of the first GST, with 88 per cent of Parties indicating that their NDCs were informed by the outcomes of the GST and 80 per cent specifying how; (c) The emissions trajectories set out in the new NDCs are broadly consistent with a linear trajectory from the Parties\u2019 2030 targets to their long-term net zero targets, showing that Parties are laying out clear stepping-stones towards net zero, although acceleration of action is still needed; (d) Collectively, the new NDCs show a reduction in projected emissions of 17 (11\u201324) per cent below the 2019 level; (e) All NDCs go beyond mitigation to include elements, inter",

With regard to GHG emission reductions, the total GHG emission level resulting from the implementation of Parties\u2019 new NDCs is projected to be around 13.0 (12.0\u201313.9)1 Gt CO2 eq in 2035, which is 6 per cent below the projected 2030 level reported in those Parties\u2019 previous NDCs and 17 (11\u201324) per cent below the 2019 level. Full implementation of all new NDCs, including all conditional elements, is estimated to bring the total GHG emission level of the relevant group of Parties down to 12.3 (12.0\u201312.7) Gt CO2 eq by 2035, which would be 19\u201324 per cent below the 2019 level. Implementation of their new NDCs will result in a peaking of GHG emissions for the group of Parties before 2030, with strong emission reductions thereafter until 2035. Most of the new NDCs are linked to the Parties\u2019 long-term decarbonization targets and development pathways, including the net zero targets 1 A triplet of emission levels indicates the best-estimate and the min-max projection range arising from ranges in NDC targets and uncertainties in the quantification. If not otherwise stated, the range spans both high and low quantifications of conditional and unconditional targets. 4 FCCC/PA/CMA/2025/8 communicated in the NDCs or LT-LEDS, which involve reaching net zero emissions by between 2040 and 2060, with the majority for 2050. The aggregate emission level of the Parties projected for 2035 is approximately consistent with a linear trajectory from the estimated 2030 emission level to their aggregate targeted net zero emission level. 3. Nearly all Parties (98 per cent) communicated domestic mitigation measures in their new NDCs, with 80 per cent reporting measures for at least one of the six low-cost mitigation options with the highest mitigation potential (more than 2 Gt CO2 eq/year) for up to 2035. Among such options, afforestation and reforestation, solar energy and reducing deforestation are identified as the options with the greater need for support.

Among such options, afforestation and reforestation, solar energy and reducing deforestation are identified as the options with the greater need for support. Quantitative targets relevant to at least one of the global efforts or mitigation options covered in recent CMA decisions were reported by 75 per cent of Parties, of which 47 per cent made direct references to specific efforts or options. In addition to the information in the NDCs, some Parties have announced domestic pledges and projects relevant to the above-mentioned global efforts, including in relation to tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030, enhancing low- carbon hydrogen production and expanding CCUS capacity. The combined effects of these pledges and projects are projected to significantly exceed the aggregated targets based on the NDCs for the same global efforts, indicating that submitted NDCs do not cover all domestically announced pledges and projects. Some Parties may nationally determine that progress in these areas, along with other contributing factors such as enhanced international cooperation and support, contributes to potential for accelerated implementation and more ambition. 4. Parties widely recognized and positively responded to the outcomes of the first GST2 in their NDCs. A total of 88 per cent of Parties indicated that their new NDCs were informed by the findings of and calls arising from the first GST, with 80 per cent of Parties providing information supporting that claim. In terms of considering the GST outcomes in their NDCs, Parties referenced enhanced ambition of mitigation (77 per cent), adaptation (38 per cent), means of implementation (33 per cent), loss and damage (14 per cent), response measures (13 per cent) and international cooperation (17 per cent), as well as cross-cutting elements such as just transition, stakeholder engagement and gender-responsiveness. Some Parties indicated how the targets, commitments and actions in their NDCs will contribute to global efforts in relation to tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030; transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems; conserving, protecting and restoring nature and ecosystems; promoting sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production; and enhancing adaptation efforts towards achieving the global goal on adaptation. 5. An increasing trend in NDCs mentioning mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation action and/or economic diversification plans can be observed. NDCs are also increasingly mentioning plans to address impacts arising from mitigation actions by embedding consideration of just transition in the NDCs, thus indicating growing recognition of the importance of just transition. 6.

A total of 70 per cent of Parties considered just transition in preparing their new NDCs and the majority of those Parties plan to integrate consideration of just transition into NDC implementation. It is also evident that Parties considered just transition across all aspects of their NDCs, including mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, and for a variety of sectors and stakeholders, which points to a whole-of-economy and -society approach to considering just transition. Some Parties contextualized just transition as helping to ensure that the shift to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies does not exacerbate existing or create new inequalities in societies, thus enabling climate action that is socially inclusive and economically empowering. Plans to monitor or track just transition as part of NDC implementation were explicitly indicated by 8 per cent of Parties. 7. The increase in Parties indicating their intention to participate in voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to contribute to reaching their climate targets continued in the new NDCs. 89 per cent of Parties indicated that they plan to or may use at least one of the scopes of voluntary cooperation under Article 6, in comparison with 64 per cent in the previous NDCs; with 17 per cent of Parties mentioning the general use of 2 See decision 1/CMA.5. 5 FCCC/PA/CMA/2025/8 voluntary cooperation under Article 6, 72 per cent referring to the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes under Article 6, paragraphs 2 and 4, and 20 per cent expressing interest in non-market approaches under Article 6, paragraph 8. Following the completion of the negotiations on the implementation of Article 6 at COP 29, more Parties are beginning to define their approach to voluntary cooperation and establish the legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks needed to implement and benefit from Article 6. 8. Acknowledging the fundamental role of forests in keeping 1.5 \u00b0C within reach, Parties have integrated forest measures into economy-wide mitigation targets and mentioned forest-specific contributions and indicators in their new NDCs. Parties highlighted international collaboration and REDD+ results-based payments as key to mitigation in the forest sector, while noting synergies with achieving adaptation and biodiversity objectives. Developing country Parties referenced their national REDD+ strategies and safeguards, and ongoing implementation of REDD+ as central to their climate responses. More Parties than previously included in their NDCs a broader range of forest actions, covering reducing deforestation and forest degradation, afforestation and reforestation, sustainable forest management, policy frameworks and risk management measures addressing wildfire, pests and diseases, often with indicative costings and financing needs, and thus constituting coherent climate action packages.

Persistent funding gaps remain, with Parties stressing that predictable domestic and international finance, including REDD+ results-based payments, is essential for turning ambition into durable outcomes, supported by inclusive governance and national systems. 9. Parties reported a significant increase in ocean-based climate action compared with the previous NDCs, with 78 per cent of Parties including in the new NDCs at least one explicit reference to the ocean \u2013 an increase of 39 per cent. Of the 48 per cent of Parties that reported finance-related needs for ocean-based action, 46 per cent have made conditional commitments, which were mostly identified by small island developing States to implement ocean-related climate measures. Ocean-based adaptation remains prominent, with measures relating to coastal resilience-building through integrated coastal zone management, marine spatial planning, strengthening the resilience of coastal and marine tourism and responding to sea level rise, conservation and restoration of blue carbon ecosystems through nature-based solutions and marine protected areas, and fisheries and aquaculture. Though fewer in number, reported ocean-based mitigation measures show increasing innovation and sectoral diversity, spanning renewable energy deployment, blue carbon sequestration, fisheries and aquaculture, and decarbonization of maritime transport. 10. A total of 73 per cent of Parties included an adaptation component in their new NDCs, focusing on the adaptation priority areas of food security and nutrition, water resources, health, terrestrial ecosystems, key economic sectors, disaster risk management, urban and rural areas, ocean ecosystems, coastal and low-lying regions, poverty and livelihoods, and education. Parties demonstrated progress across several areas of adaptation, including strengthening adaptation-relevant research, data and monitoring to support evidence-based action; developing and implementing adaptation-related policy frameworks; formulating and advancing NAPs; aligning adaptation strategies with the United Arab Emirates Framework for Global Climate Resilience; defining time-bound adaptation targets and indicators for tracking progress; and identifying synergies between adaptation and mitigation efforts, and linkages between adaptation action and efforts towards achieving the SDGs. A total of 94 per cent of Parties with an adaptation component in their new NDCs, compared with 68 per cent in their previous NDCs, referred to loss and damage, outlining observed and projected loss and damage in various key sectors and describing planned or implemented measures to avert, minimize or address loss and damage. 11. Parties reaffirmed in their new NDCs their strong commitment to climate multilateralism under the Convention and the Paris Agreement, recognizing international cooperation as indispensable for strengthening climate action and achieving the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals",

Parties reaffirmed in their new NDCs their strong commitment to climate multilateralism under the Convention and the Paris Agreement, recognizing international cooperation as indispensable for strengthening climate action and achieving the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals to avert the worst human and economic impacts of global warming. International cooperation was emphasized as critical for mobilizing resources and bridging the gap between NDC ambition and implementation by 97 per cent of Parties. In addition to fulfilling commitments under the Convention and the Paris Agreement, such as NDCs, Parties described their engagement with international partners to promote effective and 6 FCCC/PA/CMA/2025/8 inclusive climate action through voluntary cooperation initiatives, regional collaboration and sectoral activities such as energy transition. 12. Information on climate finance was included in their new NDCs by 75 per cent of Parties, most often in terms of support needed for NDC implementation, with fewer referencing their role as finance providers. Costed needs were presented by 21 per cent more Parties in their new NDCs than previously, particularly for adaptation, reflecting their increased ambition, broader sectoral coverage and efforts to integrate climate finance into national budgeting and policy frameworks. Nearly 63 per cent of Parties referenced efforts to develop climate financing strategies or investment plans to support NDC implementation. Parties reporting financial needs provided cost estimates ranging from aggregate totals to sector-specific breakdowns, amounting to USD 1,970.8\u20131,975.0 billion overall. Mitigation finance needs, estimated at USD 1,339 billion, are concentrated in the energy, AFOLU, IPPU and waste sectors; while adaptation finance needs, estimated at USD 560.5\u2013564.6 billion, are focused in agriculture, water, infrastructure, health, biodiversity and disaster risk management sectors. A total of 84 per cent of the Parties that reported costed needs identified a mix of international and domestic sources of finance needed, including public and private sources. Parties noted that international support is sought through bilateral finance, multilateral climate funds, multilateral development banks and private sector investment. Parties also reported that they are exploring use of sovereign instruments such as green bonds and social and sustainability bond instruments as well as innovative finance such as maritime levies, de-risking instruments like credit guarantees, and green credit lines. 13. With regard to technology development and transfer and innovation, 97 per cent of Parties provided information, at varying levels of detail, on technology priorities and/or needs in their new NDCs, 45 per cent of which include both qualitative and quantitative aspects.

A total of 92 per cent of Parties outlined technology priorities and/or needs in support of mitigation and 72 per cent in support of adaptation. The predominant share of these needs and priorities for mitigation are related to the energy, transport and AFOLU sectors, which were cited by a majority of Parties (more than 50 per cent). For adaptation, in addition to agrifood systems and the water sector, which were among the most frequently cited priorities in previous NDCs, a majority of Parties (more than 50 per cent) referred to technology measures related to climate monitoring and observations in their new NDCs, often combined with geospatial tools and digital solutions, including use of artificial intelligence. The share of Parties (73 per cent) that referred to measures related to technology innovation, research and demonstration for achieving their climate targets has more than doubled since their previous NDCs. institutional strengthening are 14. Capacity-building and increasingly being recognized as important for NDC implementation. Of the 84 per cent of Parties that referenced capacity-building in their new NDCs, 66 per cent indicated that NDC implementation is contingent upon receiving capacity-building support. Needs were identified across adaptation, mitigation and cross-cutting areas, including transparency, technology deployment and access to climate finance. A total of 25 per cent of Parties highlighted capacity needs related to addressing loss and damage and accessing related funds, which were not reflected in their previous NDCs. Parties referred to institutional arrangements and stakeholder engagement as part of their capacity-building efforts. 15. A total of 97 per cent of Parties provided information in their new NDCs on the legal and policy frameworks that facilitate their NDC implementation. The nature of such frameworks varies across Parties and includes acts, laws and decrees as well as policies, strategies and plans. The adoption of comprehensive climate change acts, laws or decrees that establish the legal framework for NDC implementation was pointed to by 41 per cent of Parties. On the policy side, 39 per cent of Parties referred to their national climate change policies and 41 per cent to their national climate change strategies and plans as important instruments for supporting NDC implementation. Further, a total of 94 per cent of Parties reported on legal and policy instruments that contribute to NDC implementation in key sectors such as energy, environment, water, waste, agriculture and food security, forestry, disaster risk reduction and management, health, urban and spatial planning, transport, and buildings, construction and infrastructure.

Among these, the environment sector stands out, 7 FCCC/PA/CMA/2025/8 with 77 per cent of Parties providing information on environmental legal and policy instruments containing climate-related components. Climate change considerations have also been incorporated within sustainable development frameworks: 47 per cent of Parties highlighted sustainable development legislation, agendas, strategies and plans as instruments that underpin the legal and policy frameworks that facilitate NDC implementation. 16. The new NDCs reflect a deepening and more structured engagement of non-Party stakeholders in climate action. An increasing number of Parties are involving subnational entities, the private sector and civil society in both the design and implementation of NDCs. Notably, 95 per cent of Parties reported engagement of non-Party stakeholders in NDC implementation, 20 per cent more than in their previous NDCs. Subnational entities are increasingly involved as partners in planning, implementing and monitoring climate action, helping to embed national goals into local plans for coherent implementation. The private sector is positioned as a co-implementer and financier, contributing through innovation, partnerships and investment mobilization. Civil society and academia play vital roles in shaping inclusive policies, advancing climate justice and providing scientific expertise. Parties are collaborating with non-Party stakeholders through voluntary efforts, initiatives and coalitions to mobilize resources and scale up climate action, and reported in the NDCs that enhanced enabling environments, such as appropriate incentives, sectoral road maps and knowledge platforms, are supporting stakeholder contributions. This shift from broad consultation to multi-stakeholder implementation underscores an increasing whole-of- society and whole-of-economy approach to climate action, thus signalling an alignment with the outcomes of the first GST and reinforcing the importance of collaborative climate governance. 17. Parties provided clearer and more detailed information than previously on ACE in their new NDCs.3 All Parties provided information on using at least one ACE element to promote implementation of mitigation and adaptation activities, generally communicating more clearly, and in more detail, than in the previous NDCs on general principles, past achievements, future commitments, and needs and gaps in relation to ACE. 18. Gender integration into NDCs is advancing, with Parties increasingly considering gender to promote inclusive and effective climate action. In their new NDCs, 89 per cent of Parties provided information related to gender and 80 per cent affirmed that they will take gender into account in implementing the NDCs.

Of the Parties that referenced gender in their previous NDCs, 51 per cent elaborated more on the topic in their new NDCs. 19. A total of 72 per cent of Parties reported an increased focus on the vital role of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in climate adaptation and mitigation, compared with 66 per cent previously. Parties not only acknowledged the particular climate change vulnerabilities of Indigenous Peoples and local communities but also emphasized the importance of strengthening climate action through integration of traditional, Indigenous and local knowledge and the increased participation of these groups in climate leadership. Parties highlighted the benefits of combining traditional and modern practices while ensuring the participation and leadership of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in climate efforts. Adaptation actions involving Indigenous Peoples and local communities include developing community-based adaptation plans; implementing measures related to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems, food security, water resources and disaster risk management; and using indicators to monitor adaptation progress. Mitigation involving Indigenous Peoples and local communities include measures related to sustainable waste and forestry management, mangrove restoration, low-carbon maritime transport, solar-powered irrigation and clean cooking solutions. 3 ACE denotes work under Article 12 of the Paris Agreement. Its objective is to empower all members of society to engage in climate action through education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information and international cooperation on these matters (the six ACE elements). Decision 1/CMA.5, para. 176, emphasized the importance of ACE for empowering all members of society to engage in climate action and for the consideration of the outcomes of the first GST. 8 FCCC/PA/CMA/2025/8 20.

In accordance with the Paris Agreement, each Party is to prepare, communicate and maintain, every five years, successive NDCs that it intends to achieve and each successive NDC will represent progression reflecting the Party\u2019s highest possible ambition and be informed by the outcomes of the GST.4 The communicated NDCs are to be recorded in the NDC registry, maintained by the secretariat. 22. Further, under the Paris Agreement, in communicating their NDCs, Parties are to provide the information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding in accordance with decision 1/CP.21 and any relevant decisions of the CMA.5 23. COP 21 decided that Parties shall submit their NDCs to the secretariat at least 9\u201312 months in advance of the relevant CMA session with a view to facilitating the clarity, transparency and understanding of the NDCs, including through a synthesis report prepared by the secretariat.6 24. CMA 1 adopted further guidance on the information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding of NDC. 7 It emphasized that the guidance is without prejudice to the inclusion of components other than information on mitigation in an NDC and decided that, in communicating their second and subsequent NDCs, Parties shall provide the information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding as applicable to their NDCs.8 25. CMA 3 requested the secretariat to annually update the NDC synthesis report and to make it available to the CMA at each of its sessions.9 26. CMA 5, reaffirming the nationally determined nature of NDCs and Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement, encouraged Parties to come forward in their next NDCs (2025) with ambitious, economy-wide emission reduction targets, covering all GHGs, sectors and categories and aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C, as informed by the latest science, in the light of different national circumstances.

NDC implementation are described in a separate technical document.14 III. Overview of nationally determined contributions The NDCs considered in this report cover about 30 per cent of total global emissions 31. (excluding LULUCF) in 2019. 32. A total of 91 per cent of Parties provided the information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding of their NDCs in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 8, of the Paris Agreement and paragraph 27 of decision 1/CP.21. 33. Furthermore, all Parties provided other information, such as on policy frameworks, gender, children and youth, Indigenous Peoples and local communities, ACE, non-Party stakeholder engagement, international cooperation, outcomes of the GST, just transition, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, forests, ocean, mitigation co-benefits, adaptation, domestic mitigation measures, and means of implementation necessary for NDC implementation. The relevant information is synthesized in the chapters below. 34. All Parties communicated in their NDCs the time frame and/or period of implementation, which refers to a time in the future by or in which an objective is to be achieved. A total of 89 per cent of Parties communicated a time frame and/or period of implementation of until 2035, while 9 per cent of Parties specified periods of until 2030 and 2 per cent until 2041. 35. All Parties prepared their NDCs taking into account their unique national circumstances, covering factors such as government structure, population (i.e. size and density), economic profile (e.g. export-oriented or reliant on international trade), climate conditions (e.g. vulnerabilities such as arid environments, water scarcity and heat) and geographical characteristics (e.g. landlocked, mountainous, coastal and archipelagic profiles). 11 Andorra, Angola, Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Botswana, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Holy See, Iceland, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Madagascar, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Micronesia (Federated States of), Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Namibia, Nepal, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Niue, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, Saint",

In addition, 67 per cent of Parties highlighted contextual aspirations and priority areas in relation to NDC preparation and implementation, such as maximizing synergies between short- and long-term climate commitments and the SDGs; facilitating adaptation and climate- resilient development; facilitating international cooperation among Parties and international organizations for the provision of financial, technological and capacity-building support; deploying low-emission technologies to drive emission reduction; safeguarding food security and human health and eradicating poverty; involving youth, local governments and communities and Indigenous Peoples in a gender-responsive and human rights-based approach; ensuring just transition of the workforce; promoting social and climate justice, circular economy and integrated resource management; ensuring the ecological integrity of ecosystems, oceans and blue carbon; reducing the risk of disasters; and reducing the impacts of loss and damage associated with climate change. 37. All Parties explained how they consider their NDCs to be fair and ambitious in the light of their national circumstances. Frequently highlighted elements include Parties\u2019 efforts to reduce emissions despite considering their own responsibility for causing climate change to be limited owing to their low share in either current or historical global emissions, limited financial resources and technical capacity, the need to address other socioeconomic and sustainable development priorities such as poverty eradication, and the need to prioritize adaptation efforts because of high vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change. 38. A total of 48 per cent of Parties framed fairness consideration in the context of their past, current and future share in global emissions and per capita emissions compared with global averages. Other aspects of fairness described by Parties include the decoupling of economic development from emission growth; climate justice; mitigation potential; cost of mitigation actions; and degree of progression15 beyond the current level of effort. 39. All Parties included information on how their NDCs represent progression and their highest possible ambition. This",

All Parties included information on how their NDCs represent progression and their highest possible ambition. This progression is demonstrated by setting more ambitious and comprehensive targets, expanding sectoral and gas coverage, strengthening policy and legislative frameworks, and aligning targets with scientific recommendations and national circumstances. The enhanced emission reduction targets are aligned with the long-term objective of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Building on existing policies, measures and investments, new commitments relating to adaptation and addressing loss and damage have been introduced, setting a pathway towards a resilient, net zero society by 2050. 40. Meanwhile, 33 per cent of Parties provided information on ambition by linking their NDCs to their commitment to transition to a sustainable and/or low-carbon and resilient economy; 13 per cent expressed that they have incorporated their NDC goals and policies into national legislative, regulatory and planning processes as a means of ensuring implementation; and 11 per cent addressed ambition in the context of the inclusive design of their NDCs, considering various cross-cutting aspects, such as investment plans, gender- responsiveness, education and just transition. 41. Further, 41 per cent of Parties stated that their NDCs are in line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement or with the mitigation pathways towards limiting global warming to well below 2 or 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. IV. Cross-cutting elements, including planning and implementation processes, in nationally determined contributions 42. A total of 98 per cent of Parties indicated that domestic institutional arrangements are a key element of coordinating, planning and implementing climate change policy and action at the national and international level.

Such efforts include reviewing and consolidating monitoring and evaluation frameworks and tools, tracking progress in implementing and achieving NDC targets, developing methods for evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation actions, strengthening climate transparency systems such as the ETF, improving institutional arrangements for monitoring and evaluation, aligning adaptation indicators with the SDGs and other international frameworks, and improving inclusivity by collecting disaggregated data on gender, children and youth, Indigenous Peoples and local communities, people with disabilities and the elderly. Additionally, 62 per cent of Parties identified and described their intention to apply time-bound quantified adaptation targets for monitoring the progress of adaptation measures, while 28 per cent reported developing the adaptation indicators that they intend to use for monitoring progress. 7. Synergies with mitigation and sustainable development 143. The share of Parties that identified in their adaptation component synergies between adaptation and mitigation, particularly in the terrestrial and ocean ecosystems, food security and nutrition, water resources and health sectors, increased from 53 per cent in the previous NDCs to 81 per cent in the new NDCs (mitigation co-benefits of adaptation actions are covered in chap.

Examples of synergies include increasing the resilience of mangroves and seagrasses (nature-based solutions) to reduce coastal flooding and increase carbon sequestration; improving forest carbon stock through restoration, afforestation and conservation of native forest species; implementing climate-smart agriculture in order to diversify crops, foster soil conservation and increase carbon sequestration; improving water reservoirs and pumped storage schemes to ensure water security; and reducing respiratory diseases through reduced use of fossil fuels (pollution). 144. A total of 68 per cent of Parties described how adaptation actions relate to sustainable development frameworks, describing the overall linkages and synergies between their adaptation efforts and efforts towards the SDGs; and identifying the essential role of adaptation in the achievement of SDGs, as well as the role of sustainable development in successful adaptation. Further, 36 per cent of Parties specified how adaptation in specific priority areas contributes to achieving individual SDGs. Figure 10 provides an overview of the specific synergies identified between sectoral adaptation efforts and efforts towards the SDGs. 34 Figure 10 Synergies between efforts in adaptation priority sectors and efforts towards the Sustainable Development Goals identified in nationally determined contributions FCCC/PA/CMA/2025/8 Note: The shading reflects how frequently linkages were identified by Parties: the darker the shading, the more frequently linkages were identified. 8. Loss and damage associated with climate change impacts 145. A total of 94 per cent of Parties with an adaptation component referred to loss and damage, outlining the associated risks and impacts in various key sectors and describing planned or implemented measures to address them, compared with 68 per cent in their previous NDCs (see figure 11). They also considered the financial and capacity-building needs and commitments associated with addressing loss and damage. 146. Overall, 79 per cent of Parties, compared with 45 per cent in their previous NDCs, reported experiencing loss and damage, for example owing to the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as drought, floods and tropical cyclones, as well as slow-onset events such as rising sea levels, glacier retreat, and ocean warming and acidification. Both economic and non-economic loss and damage was reported. Economic loss and damage was typically expressed as annual monetary damage or loss in gross domestic product relating to the sectors of food security and nutrition, infrastructure, ocean and terrestrial ecosystems, and water resources, while non-economic loss and damage was reported in relation to cultural heritage values (both tangible and intangible), loss of human life, and community displacement or climate-led migration.

Greenhouse gas emission estimates taking into account implementation of the new nationally determined contributions 156. Total GHG emission levels resulting from the implementation of Parties\u2019 new NDCs are projected to be around 13.9 (13.3\u201314.6)Gt CO2 eq in 2030 and around 13.0 (12.0\u201313.9) Gt CO2 eq in 203536 for the Parties that submitted the NDCs (see figure 15). 157. In comparison with the GHG emission levels reported in those Parties\u2019 previous NDCs, the new NDCs are estimated to result in emission levels for the Parties in 2035 that are 6 per cent (0.8 Gt CO2 eq) below the 2030 level reported in the previous NDCs. When looking exclusively at the 2030 level, the projected emission levels do not change substantially between the new and previous NDCs as the new NDCs predominantly focus on 2035. 158. A total of 88 per cent of Parties included unconditional elements and 67 per cent included additional, more ambitious conditional elements, implementation of which depends mostly on access to enhanced financial resources, technology transfer, technical cooperation and capacity-building support; availability of market-based mechanisms; an international system that facilitates NDC implementation and sustainable development; and the absorptive capacity of forests and other ecosystems. Compared with their previous NDCs, 5 per cent fewer Parties included unconditional elements in their new NDCs. 159. Total GHG emission levels resulting from the implementation of the unconditional elements of the new NDCs are estimated to be 14.5 (14.4\u201314.6) Gt CO2 eq in 2030 and 13.6 (13.3\u201313.9) Gt CO2 eq in 2035 for the relevant group of Parties. On the other hand, assuming full implementation of all new NDCs, including all conditional elements, those emission levels are estimated to be lower in 2030, at 13.4 (13.3\u201313.5) Gt CO2 eq, and even lower in 2035, at 12.3 (12.0\u201312.7) Gt CO2 eq (see figure 15).

Domestic mitigation measures 1. Domestic mitigation measures for priority areas 173. A total of 98 per cent of Parties (the same share as in their previous NDCs) outlined in their new NDCs domestic mitigation measures as key instruments for achieving mitigation targets for their NDCs and/or specific priority areas, including energy supply, transport, buildings, industry, AFOLU and waste. Specifically, Parties communicated measures most frequently in the priority area of energy supply, followed by transport and AFOLU. According to UNEP,37 these three priority areas together accounted for about 70 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2023 (see figure 16). 37 Emissions shares of priority areas were estimated on the basis of data from UNEP. 2024.

Global efforts and mitigation options covered in recent decisions 176. As shown in figure 16, energy-related emissions accounted for over three quarters of global emissions in 2023. A total of 75 per cent of Parties reported in their NDCs quantitative targets relevant to at least one of energy-related global efforts or mitigation options covered in decisions 1/CMA.3, 1/CMA.4 and 1/CMA.541 (for further information, see the additional information on domestic mitigation measures42). These include, but are not limited to:43 (a) Tripling renewable energy capacity globally by 2030: 44 per cent of Parties indicated quantitative targets for increasing the installed capacity for renewables-based electricity generation by 2030, amounting to 0.6 TW; (b) Doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030: 5 per cent of Parties communicated targets for increasing the average annual rate of primary energy intensity improvement by 2030, equating to an aggregated average annual improvement rate through to 2030 of 2.3 per cent; 40 The difference between the shares of Parties that communicated domestic mitigation measures in their NDCs aimed at fully or partially conditional targets and the share that referred to measures aimed at fully unconditional targets. It is calculated by subtracting the share of Parties referring to measures aimed at fully unconditional mitigation targets from the share referring to measures aimed at fully or partially conditional mitigation targets. For example, the conditionality gap for solar energy (25 percentage points) is derived from 39 per cent of Parties that included measures for solar energy aimed at fully or partially conditional mitigation targets and 14 per cent that communicated measures for solar energy aimed at fully unconditional mitigation targets. 41 For non-energy-related global efforts or mitigation options, see chap.

A comprehensive estimate of the aggregated targets referred to in this paragraph will only be possible once all new NDCs have been submitted. 44 FCCC/PA/CMA/2025/8 (c) Phasing down unabated coal power: 13 per cent of Parties reported quantitative targets for reducing coal power generation by 2030, amounting to a 33 TWh reduction. Additionally, 16 per cent communicated such targets for 2035, totalling a 776 TWh reduction; (d) Transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems in a just, orderly and equitable manner: nearly half of Parties (47 per cent), accounting for 9 per cent of total global electricity generation from fossil fuels in 2023, indicated quantitative targets for reducing the share of unabated fossil fuels in electricity generation by 2030, while 73 per cent of Parties reported the need and/or measures for a just transition for communities and workers dependent on fossil fuels; (e) Accelerating zero- and low-emission technologies: 3 per cent of Parties indicated quantitative targets for installed nuclear power capacity by 2035, amounting to 10 GW. Additionally, 8 per cent communicated quantitative targets for increasing annual carbon capture capacity by 2035, totalling 39 Mt CO2. Further, 3 per cent reported quantitative targets for increasing low-carbon hydrogen production by 2035, amounting to 1.5 Mt; (f) Accelerating the substantial reduction of non-CO2 emissions globally, in particular CH4 emissions, by 2030: 3 per cent of Parties included quantitative targets for reducing CH4 emissions from fossil fuel operations by 2030, amounting to a 2 Mt reduction. 177. In addition to the information in NDCs, some Parties have announced domestic pledges and projects 44 relevant to the above-mentioned global efforts, including tripling renewable energy capacity globally by 2030, enhancing low-carbon hydrogen production and expanding capture capacity for CCUS. The combined effects of these pledges and projects are projected to significantly exceed the aggregated targets based on the NDCs for the same global efforts, indicating that submitted NDCs do not cover all domestically announced pledges and projects. Some Parties may nationally determine that progress in these areas, along with other contributing factors such as enhanced international cooperation and support, contributes to potential for accelerated implementation and more ambition. For example, for the 64 Parties that have submitted new NDCs, it is estimated that total domestically announced commitments for renewable energy capacity by 2030 reach 2 TW,45 representing more than 3.5 times the 0.6 TW aggregated target capacity according to the NDCs submitted",

Regarding CO2 removal technologies other than CCUS referred to in paragraph 176(e) above, 9 per cent of Parties indicated measures for direct air carbon capture and storage and 3 per cent measures for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. According to the Synthesis Report of the AR6, 46 1.5 \u00b0C pathways with no or limited overshoot require cumulative net-negative emissions of 220 Gt CO2 by 2100, increasing to 360 Gt CO2 for 1.5 \u00b0C pathways with a high overshoot.47 Deep GHG emission reductions by 2030 and 2040, including substantial reductions in CH4 emissions, as referenced to in paragraph 176(f) above, could reduce peak warming levels, thereby reducing feasibility and sustainability concerns regarding the large-scale deployment of CO2 removal technologies. 179. All Parties reported measures or quantitative targets relevant to global efforts or mitigation options referred to in decision 1/CMA.5. Informed by the outcomes of the first GST, 61 per cent of Parties made direct references to these efforts or options in their NDCs (see figure 18). The most frequently cited was tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030, followed by doubling the average annual rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030 and transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems.

Coherence and synergies with development priorities 180. A total of 87 per cent of Parties, a sharp increase from 16858 per cent in their previous NDCs, highlighted policy coherence and synergies between their mitigation measures and development priorities, including LT-LEDS and SDGs. 181. Nearly half of those Parties (41 per cent) identified domestic mitigation measures in the context of longer-term measures or targets set out in their LT-LEDS and/or other national long-term low-emission development strategies or laws. In addition, the same share of Parties (41 per cent) communicated one or more SDGs in relation to which there are synergies with their priority areas or mitigation measures (see figure 19), clarifying the alignment between their mitigation measures and efforts towards achieving the SDGs.

A total cost in the range of USD 1,970.8\u20131,975.0 billion in aggregate was reported as climate finance required for NDCs by 52 per cent of Parties, comprising USD 1,073.88\u20131074.00 billion identified as support needed from international sources, USD 214.4 billion identified to derive from domestic sources and USD 682.5\u2013686.5 billion for which the source was not specified. 183. Of the Parties providing information on climate finance support needed, 29 per cent included such information throughout their NDCs, such as in thematic chapters on adaptation and mitigation, 42 per cent in a stand-alone section on climate finance and 31 per cent in a means of implementation section. Further, 63 per cent of Parties also referenced or indicated ongoing efforts to develop financing strategies or investment plans to support NDC implementation and 21 per cent did not provide any information on climate finance. Figure 20 Climate finance information in nationally determined contributions 184. The level of detail of cost estimates varied across NDCs, with some Parties reporting total cost estimates at the aggregated level, some presenting cost estimates by sector or area and some differentiating between conditional support required and unconditional funds for implementing their NDCs. The starting points for costed estimates in NDCs also varied, from as early as 2021 to as late as 2031. 185. A total of 90 per cent of the Parties that provided information on climate finance required stated the sources of finance expected to be used in implementing their NDCs, with 56 per cent referring to a mix of international and domestic sources, including both public and private sources, 31 per cent to international sources only and 2 per cent to domestic sources only, with the remaining 10 per cent not specifying this information. Some 46 per cent of Parties differentiated their financial needs between conditional and unconditional support. Domestic sources are often used to address unconditional commitments outlined in the NDCs or for a specific area or sector being prioritized, and include national budget allocations, public sector investment programmes, loans received from international sources (which are to be repaid domestically) and revenues from domestic fiscal measures. Meanwhile, international sources, obtained from a variety of public, private and blended sources of finance, including bilateral and multilateral channels such as multilateral climate funds, multilateral development banks and the private sector, include green energy bonds, 47 FCCC/PA/CMA/2025/8 sustainable sovereign bonds, multi-funder trust funds and debt-for-climate swaps.

In addition, leveraging mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement was mentioned by 53 per cent of Parties as an essential financial instrument for mobilizing financial resources or attracting investment to support NDC implementation. 186. Of the Parties reporting costed finance needs, 82 per cent identified needs for mitigation in the energy (including transport and power generation), AFOLU, IPPU and waste sectors. Some 76 per cent of the Parties reporting costed finance needs identified adaptation needs primarily related to agriculture and food security, water resources, infrastructure, health and water, sanitation and hygiene, biodiversity and ecosystems, tourism, and disaster and climate risk management. Some Parties highlighted that their NAPs are central to achieving their adaptation priorities and referenced specific adaptation needs. A total of 15 per cent of Parties included costed cross-cutting needs, while 12 per cent of Parties included needs related to addressing loss and damage in the adaptation component of their NDCs and 15 per cent of Parties reported needs related to addressing loss and damage in a separate chapter of their NDCs. 187. Overall, 47 per cent of Parties recognized the importance of considering gender and the perspectives of Indigenous Peoples and vulnerable groups in financing NDC implementation, including through gender-responsive budgeting, costed needs assessments, targeted financial incentives, institutional strategies and partnerships. 188. Some 77 per cent of Parties that reported needs in their NDCs reported finance-related challenges and limitations related to implementing their NDCs, including: (a) Difficulties in identifying actual financial needs owing to cost estimates being preliminary in nature or underestimated, limited data availability and quality, insufficient institutional and technical capacity, fragmented planning frameworks, and persistent knowledge management and data availability gaps that impede comprehensive identification of financial needs; (b) Limited and delayed access to finance owing to lengthy application procedures, co-financing requirements, lack of direct budgetary support, financing structures that are not fit for purpose, geopolitical restrictions, and insufficient and unpredictable global finance flows; (c) Difficulties in mobilizing private finance owing to low profitability in vulnerable sectors, high perceived risks, limited investor appetite for adaptation and inadequate project preparation capacity; (d) Debt burden and fiscal constraints arising from high debt levels, limited fiscal space and the diversion of resources from sustainable development to address needs perceived as more urgent. Parties noted that economic shocks, high ratios of debt to gross domestic product and competing development priorities continue to erode fiscal space, constraining public investment in climate action. 189.

Compared with in their previous NDCs, 21 per cent more Parties provided cost estimates for the first time in their new NDCs, while 10 per cent of Parties that had provided quantitative information in their previous NDC did not provide quantitative information in their new NDCs. Additionally, 18 per cent more Parties provided cost estimates for adaptation-related needs, reflecting a growing focus on integrating climate change considerations into national budgeting processes, public financial management systems and the development of NDC implementation plans, climate finance policies and strategies. 2. Technology development and transfer and innovation 190. A total of 97 per cent of Parties provided information on technology development and transfer, highlighting their priorities and/or needs, at varying degrees of granularity. About 45 per cent of those Parties included both qualitative and quantitative aspects related to technology needs and priorities, marking an increase in the share of Parties including quantitative information since their previous NDCs. 191. About 75 per cent of Parties provided specific information on technology-related measures, mainly in the context of specific sectors, and some with a focus on specific 48 FCCC/PA/CMA/2025/8 technologies. Some 34 per cent of Parties referred to information on technology-related matters in other reports such as BTRs, NAPs and adaptation communications to complement the information provided in the NDCs. Overall, 27 per cent of Parties (a 13 per cent increase since their previous NDCs) referred to technology needs assessments as a source of information for NDC formulation or an instrument for advancing NDC implementation. 192. In terms of technology priorities and needs, 92 per cent of Parties outlined measures in support of mitigation. A sectoral analysis of these measures shows that the predominant share of these needs and priorities is related to the energy sector (cited by 88 per cent of Parties), followed by the transport and AFOLU sectors (cited by 65 and 55 per cent of Parties respectively). Compared with their previous NDCs, there is a notable increase (from 14 to 45 per cent) in the share of Parties referring to technology-related measures in the IPPU sector, including related to refrigeration and air conditioning. When referring to the outcomes of the first GST, in addition to priorities related to renewable energy and energy efficiency, around 23 per cent of Parties highlighted the current or potential role of CCUS technologies in achieving their mitigation targets, particularly in the energy and IPPU sectors. 193.

A total of 72 per cent of Parties elaborated on technology-related measures focused on adaptation. A majority of the Parties (more than 50 per cent) cited technology measures related to agrifood systems, climate monitoring and observations (increased from 22 to 55 per cent since previous NDCs) and the water sector. Many of the adaptation-focused measures were formulated to address adaptation priorities in multiple sectors (e.g. early warning systems in the agriculture, water and health sectors) and/or designed to yield co- benefits for mitigation, biodiversity and/or sustainable development (e.g. nature-based solutions and ecosystem services of forests and ocean). 194. Frequently cited cross-cutting and multi-sector technology measures include the application of digital solutions, including artificial intelligence; energy and material efficiency measures; measures for \u2018climate proofing infrastructure\u2019; and the use of integrated spatial planning tools and climate observation technologies across various sectors to reduce GHG emissions and/or enhance climate resilience. Some 20 per cent of Parties referenced technology aspects in the context of addressing loss and damage, including for assessing associated needs. 195. In articulating their needs and priorities related to technology development and transfer for achieving their NDCs, Parties included information on various types of technology (see figure 21). There is broad consistency with their previous NDCs in terms of the order of frequently cited categories of technology needs and priorities, but with a notable increase in the share of Parties referring to measures other than a specific technology, namely those pertaining to research and innovation, institutional aspects, enabling environments and planning tools. In addition, some 30 per cent of Parties underscored the interplay of technology development, implementation and uptake with capacity-building, skills development, and the creation of decent work and quality jobs. 49 FCCC/PA/CMA/2025/8 Figure 21 Categories of technology needs and priorities communicated in nationally determined contributions Specific technology Innovation, research and development Policy, regulatory and legal measures (enabling environment) 75% 73% 73% Institutional strengthening and coordination 59% Planning tools (technology needs assessments and technology roadmaps) Multi-category and others 48% 42% 196.

Parties referred to such measures as being instrumental to strengthening enabling environments for promoting the use of low- carbon and climate-resilient technologies, highlighting actions in the energy, transport, AFOLU and ecosystem sectors, among others. In this context, some Parties underscored the importance of robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms, often combined with geospatial tools and information systems, for ensuring transparency of actions and their policy and regulatory compliance, including in the context of cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. 197. The focus on technology-related data and knowledge management systems was also underscored in the context of strengthening institutional and coordination capabilities. Parties emphasized the pivotal role of such systems, which are often powered by digital solutions and accompanied by related institutional arrangements, in enabling cooperation among institutions and at different levels of governance, including for sharing information, tracking action, improving reporting and monitoring and evaluation, mobilizing support and fostering partnerships. In addition, Parties referred to government-led initiatives and programmes that are designed to promote enhanced and coordinated domestic action for technology development and deployment, including action by the private sector, citizens and youth. 198. When referring to measures related to technology innovation, research and demonstration (which 73 per cent of Parties did), 57 per cent of those Parties highlighted them as overarching priorities for advancing technology development and transfer for both mitigation and adaptation. When specified, such measures were most frequently highlighted in the context of the agriculture, forestry and energy sectors, followed by measures focused on ecosystems including ocean, and the water and waste sectors. In this regard, Parties underscored the importance of context-specific research and innovation and local technology testing, piloting and demonstration, including to foster the engagement of youth in technological innovation. 199. Parties communicated a widespread whole-of-society approach to technology implementation, with 92 per cent of Parties that included information on technology development and transfer referring to domestic implementation actors beyond the national Government for advancing technology development and transfer and 63 per cent of those Parties citing subnational governments, local authorities and local communities as key implementation actors. The private sector, farmers and worker communities, youth, women, Indigenous Peoples and members of academia were also frequently cited in this regard. 50 3.

A total of 84 per cent of Parties referenced capacity-building in varying detail, with 31 per cent of those Parties discussing it in sections on means of implementation or capacity- building, 14 per cent discussing it throughout their NDCs and 53 per cent providing only limited references or referring to external sources, such as adaptation communications, BTRs and NAPs, for more information on capacity-building support provided or needed. This broadly aligns with the Parties\u2019 previous NDCs and reflects a steady commitment towards building the capacity of developing countries. However, opportunities remain to further elevate national ambition on and adopt a more systematic approach to building capacity that could facilitate enhanced climate action. 201. A total of 66 per cent of Parties explicitly stated that the implementation of their NDCs is either fully or partially dependent on receiving capacity-building support. Parties continued to emphasize capacity-building as a critical enabler for achieving their climate goals. Capacity-building support needs were highlighted across adaptation (by 66 per cent of Parties), mitigation (by 69 per cent of Parties) and cross-cutting objectives (by 47 per cent of Parties), including transparency, technology deployment and access to climate finance. Notably, 25 per cent of Parties identified specific capacity needs related to addressing loss and damage, marking a new development not reflected in their previous NDCs. 202. Parties articulated capacity gaps and needs across multiple cross-cutting priorities, including with regard to strengthening institutional coordination, enhancing the availability and sharing of climate data and information and improving collaboration between public, private and international stakeholders. Many Parties reported challenges in accessing climate finance, particularly in navigating financial mechanisms, attracting private investment and improving financial planning, resource mobilization and utilization. Technology-related capacity needs were frequently mentioned, especially regarding the adoption of low-carbon technologies and tools for sustainable resource management and reduced environmental impacts. Additionally, capacity gaps were identified in relation to meeting the reporting requirements under the ETF, such as with regard to securing the technical expertise needed for sector-level monitoring of emission reductions, improving institutional coordination across ministries and between national and local institutions, and establishing and enabling robust MRV systems. Several Parties emphasized the need to build capacity for addressing loss and damage, such as with regard to accessing financial support, strengthening research and assessment of economic and non-economic losses and participating in the mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and in carbon markets. 203. Capacity needs were reported both across multiple sectors and within specific sectors. A total of 53 per cent of Parties cited capacity needs in the agriculture sector, such as in relation to improving climate modelling for emergency responses, promoting sustainable farming practices and advancing climate-smart agriculture; and 30 per cent of Parties highlighted needs in the energy sector,",

Capacity needs were reported both across multiple sectors and within specific sectors. A total of 53 per cent of Parties cited capacity needs in the agriculture sector, such as in relation to improving climate modelling for emergency responses, promoting sustainable farming practices and advancing climate-smart agriculture; and 30 per cent of Parties highlighted needs in the energy sector, including related to strengthening energy resilience and building technical capacity for renewable energy technologies. Other sector-specific needs relate to, inter alia, addressing climate change related diseases and impacts on human health, enhancing disaster risk reduction efforts, decarbonizing transport, enhancing the resilience of built environments, and raising public awareness of waste management practices and sustainable water management. 204. Parties described capacity-building activities aimed at enhancing public engagement and awareness-raising, technical training, education, research and innovation. Parties acknowledged the value of UNFCCC reporting processes, such as BTRs and NAPs, for their capacity development. Non-Party stakeholders, development agencies, United Nations agencies and financial mechanisms were emphasized as vital to implementing capacity- building efforts and achieving climate action objectives. 205. Consistently with their previous NDCs, Parties emphasized their capacity-building priorities for vulnerable groups, such as women, youth, and Indigenous Peoples and local communities, in relation to strengthening engagement in decision-making, increasing awareness and understanding of climate change and health-related and disaster risks, and expanding training and skills-building initiatives for green jobs. Capacity-building activities were reported frequently as having the aim of addressing capacity gaps for the stakeholders 51 FCCC/PA/CMA/2025/8 mentioned above as well as for government employees, educators, the private sector and those active in vulnerable sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries, public health and tourism. IX. Contribution towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2, and towards Article 2, paragraph 1(a), and Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement 206. The information necessary to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding of NDCs, which 91 per cent of Parties communicated, includes information on how the NDC contributes towards:48 (a) Achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2; (b) Article 2, paragraph 1(a), and Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement. 207. A total of 36 per cent of Parties indicated that their level of future emissions is expected to fall within the scope of a global emission pathway that is consistent with the goal of keeping the global average temperature increase well below 2 or limited to 1.5 \u00b0C. In that context, Parties highlighted their national mitigation and/or adaptation efforts aligned with sustainable development objectives and national circumstances, economy-wide emission reduction targets, commitment to reach net zero by mid-century, development pathways for decoupling emissions from economic growth and advancing decarbonization, enhanced measures for reforestation and ecosystem conservation, and mobilization of domestic and international",

Since this report considers 64 new NDCs, covering 30 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2019, it is not possible to provide a clear picture of the aggregated effect of all NDCs towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2, and towards Article 2, paragraph 1(a), and Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement on basis of the new NDCs, as was done in previous NDC synthesis reports.49 Aggregate emissions of Parties that submitted new nationally determined contributions 209. Total GHG emission levels resulting from the implementation of the new NDCs are projected to be around 13.9 (13.3\u201314.6) Gt CO2 eq in 2030 and around 13.0 (12.0\u201313.9) Gt CO2 eq in 2035 for the relevant group of Parties. In comparison, total global GHG emissions (without LULUCF) are estimated to be around 54.1 (51.2\u201357.0) Gt CO2 eq in 2030 (see figure 22). 210. Compared with their 2019 GHG emission levels, the implementation of Parties\u2019 new NDCs is estimated to result in a strong decline in their emissions of 11 (7\u201315) per cent by 2030 and an even stronger decline of 17 (11\u201324) per cent by 2035 (see table 2).

If none of the conditional elements are implemented, these Parties\u2019 2035 GHG emissions are projected to be 11\u201315 per cent below the 2019 level. Figure 22 Global emissions and aggregate emissions of Parties that submitted new nationally determined contributions 212. The Synthesis Report of the AR6 indicates that, in order to be in line with global modelled pathways to limiting warming to 1.5 C (with over 50 per cent likelihood in 2100) with no or limited overshoot and those to limiting warming to below 2 \u00b0C (with over 67 per cent likelihood), GHG emission reductions will have to be reduced by 60 (49\u201377) per cent by 2035 relative to the 2019 level and by 35 (22\u201355) per cent by 2035 relative to the 2019 level respectively. For 2040 and 2050, further emission reductions will be needed in order to limit warming to below 1.5 \u00b0C with no or limited overshoot, including achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 (a 99 per cent CO2 emission reduction relative to the 2019 level). 213. With their GHG emissions in 2035 on average estimated to be 17 (11\u201324) per cent below their 2019 level (see para. 211 above), the scale of the total emission reduction expected to be achieved by the group of Parties (noting that this is only about 33 per cent of Parties to the Paris Agreement) through implementation of their new NDCs falls short of what is necessary according to the IPCC ranges referred to in paragraph 212 above. 214. On a per capita basis, the Parties with new NDCs are estimated to have approximately 11 per cent higher per capita emission levels in 2019 (at 7.6 t CO2 eq) compared with the global average (6.8 t CO2 eq). The new NDCs indicate a declining trend in the group of Parties\u2019 per capita emissions, from more than 8.5 t CO2 eq in 2010 to about 5.3 t CO2 eq projected for 2035 (see figure 23). Per capita emissions for this group of Parties are estimated to decline by 11 per cent from 2030 to 2035.50 215. A total of 70 per cent of Parties with new NDCs have both 2035 emission targets in their new NDCs and long-term visions, development pathways and targets communicated in their NDCs or LT-LEDS (see para. 152 above).51 On the basis of that information, and assuming the full implementation of all NDCs and LT-LEDS, those Parties\u2019 total emissions in 2050",

Mindful of the inherent uncertainty of such long-term estimates, and the need for full implementation of NDCs, the information indicates that the total GHG emission level of Parties with new NDCs could be around 55 (50\u201360) per cent lower in 2050 than in 2019, and their annual per capita emissions would be around 2.6 (2.3\u20132.9) t CO2 eq by 2050. Under scenarios of limiting warming to likely below 2 \u00b0C (with over 67 per cent likelihood), global annual per capita emissions are estimated at 2.3 (1.8\u20132.7) t CO2 eq in 2050; hence the estimated long- term per capita emissions of these Parties are estimated at a level consistent with 2 \u00b0C scenarios. However, for scenarios of limiting warming to 1.5 \u00b0C (with 50 per cent likelihood by 2100) with limited overshoot, annual per capita emissions are required to be at 1.2 (1.0\u20131.5) t CO2 eq, which is two times lower than the projections based on new NDCs and LT-LEDS by 2050.

Earth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate. Read More What is causing climate change? Human activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century. Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20 th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\" \u2014 warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space. Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO 2 . Read More What are the effects of climate change? The effects of human-caused global warming are happening now, are irreversible for people alive today, and will worsen as long as humans add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. We already see effects scientists predicted, such as the loss of sea ice, melting glaciers and ice sheets, sea level rise, and more intense heat waves. Scientists predict global temperature increases from human-made greenhouse gases will continue. Severe weather damage will also increase and intensify.

Learn what you need to do if one is near you. Strong Santa Anna winds whipped embers as the Palisades Fires grew on the west side of Los Angeles on January 7, 2025. Fires are a natural feature of Western ecosystems, but they have become larger and deadlier in recent years. Photograph by Ringo Chiu, Reuters/Redux By Claire Wolters January 8, 2025 \u2022 11 min read Multiple large wildfires burning around Los Angeles have tens of thousands of residents evacuating as the fires show no sign of slowing their spread. The spark that caused the fires is under investigation , but the risk of wildfires developing has been extremely high in Southern California. January is typically the rainy season in Los Angeles, but this winter, rainfall has been scarce. These dry, flammable conditions were already extremely dangerous when the region&#x27;s seasonal Santa Anna winds created 100 mph gusts in some areas. ( Why This Lake Keeps Catching on Fire) These warm, dry winds spread the embers that spark new flames and can make it more difficult for firefighters to contain fires. Wildfires can burn millions of acres of land at shockingly fast speeds, consuming everything in their paths. These rolling flames travel up to 14 miles an hour, which converts to about a four-minute-mile pace, and can overtake the average human in minutes. 2:57 Destruction caused by wildfires in the United States has significantly increased in the last two decades. An average of 72,400 wildfires cleared an average of 7 million acres of U.S. land each year since 2000, double the number of acres scorched by wildfires in the 1990s. In 2020, California had its largest wildfire season in history after more than 10,000 fires burned through over 4 million acres. Get 2 Bonus Issues!

Photograph by Mark Thiessen, National Geographic (Top) (Left) and Photograph by Mark Thiessen, National Geographic (Bottom) (Right) How wildfires start Though they are classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as natural disasters , only 10 to 15 percent of wildfires occur on their own in nature. The other 85 to 90 percent result from human causes , including unattended camp and debris fires, discarded cigarettes, and arson. Naturally occurring wildfires can spark during dry weather and droughts. In these conditions, normally green vegetation becomes bone-dry, flammable fuel; strong winds spread fire quickly; and warm temperatures encourage combustion. With these ingredients, the only thing missing is a spark\u2014in the form of lightning , arson, a downed power line, or a burning campfire or cigarette\u2014to wreak havoc. Natural or man-made, three conditions must be present for a wildfire to burn: fuel, oxygen, and a heat source. Firefighters call these three elements the fire triangle. Fuel is any flammable material surrounding a fire, including trees, grasses, brush, even homes. The greater an area&#x27;s fuel load, the more intense the fire is likely to be. The most wildfire-prone state is California, which lost 2,569,386 acres of land to 7,396 wildfires in 2021. Air supplies the oxygen a fire needs to burn. California wildfires are often made worse by the hot, dry Santa Ana winds , which can carry a spark for miles. In Hawaii, Hurricane Dorian&#x27;s winds helped feed the flames that burned through Maui in 2023. Heat sources help spark the wildfire and bring fuel to temperatures hot enough to ignite. Lightning, burning campfires or cigarettes, and even the sun can all provide sufficient heat to spark a wildfire. Violent infernos are most common in the western states, where heat, drought, and frequent thunderstorms create ripe conditions. Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, Colorado, Oregon, and California experience some of the worst conflagrations. Wildfires also occur around the world and in most of the 50 states. Firefighters battle the Dixie fire in 2021, which burned nearly a million acres and destroyed most of Greenville, California, a mountain town of around a thousand residents.

Photograph by Stuart Palley, Nat Geo Image Collection How they are stopped Firefighters battle blazes by depriving them of one or more of the fire triangle fundamentals. One traditional method is to douse existing fires with water and spray fire retardants. Firefighters also sometimes work in teams, often called hotshots , to clear vegetation from the land around a fire to contain and eventually starve it of fuel. The resulting tracts of land are called firebreaks .

This method involves fighting fire with fire. These prescribed\u2014and controlled\u2014fires remove undergrowth, brush, and litter from a forest, depriving an otherwise raging wildfire of fuel. Are wildfires getting worse? While wildfires are a natural part of many ecosystems, climate change has created conditions that make fires larger, more likely to occur, and a year round threat. California has gotten about 3 degrees Fahrenheit hotter since humans began producing greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. All this persistent heat and too little rainfall sucks moisture out of the ground, creating drier, more flammable vegetation. ( Learn more about the connection between climate change and wildfire. ) The Angeles National Forest engulfed in some during the 2020 wildfire season, the worst in California's history. As temperatures increase in the West and drought persists, fire conditions are worsening. What was once a seasonal risk, now persists year round. Photograph by Stuart Palley, Nat Geo Image Collection Benefits of wildfires Although they can be dangerous to humans, naturally occurring wildfires play an integral role in nature . By burning dead or decaying matter, they can return otherwise trapped nutrients to the soil. They also act as a disinfectant, removing disease-ridden plants and harmful insects from an ecosystem. Wildfires thin forest canopies and undergrowth, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor and a new generation of seedlings to grow. In fact, some species of trees, like sequoias , rely on fire for their seeds to even open. In Hawaii, however, invasive grasses not native to the state may have worsened Maui&#x27;s fires. This flammable grass now covers about a quarter of Hawaii&#x27;s total land area, and the average area burned by wildfires",

What to do in a wildfire Wildfires devastate anything in their path. And while they are difficult to stop, there are many steps people can take before, during, and after wildfires to limit their damage. Before: If you know a wildfire is traveling toward your area, the best thing to do is leave. Immediately. If you live in a fire-prone area, it&#x27;s best to prepare ahead of time. Have an evacuation plan in mind and a \u201cgo bag\u201d with emergency supplies already packed during fire season. Trim brush, weeds, and other potential fuels on your property, especially around your home. Put away grills, propane tanks, or other flammable materials that may be in your yard. Close all doors and windows and fill sinks, tubs, and other containers with water to discourage fire. Shut off natural gas, propane, or fuel oil supplies. When you purchase a home in a wildfire-prone area, avoid neighborhoods on slopes that are steep or barren, suggests the California Chaparral Institute . Although some people fear that houses near shrubs are more likely to burn, that\u2019s not necessarily the case, the institute says. Rather, a landscape without vegetation can be the perfect runway for winds to bring embers, which are one of the biggest threats to homes during a wildfire. Wetting your roof may help reduce the risk of airborne embers catching, says the California Chaparral Institute. In fact, some people in fire-prone areas even install rooftop sprinklers for that purpose. If you cannot leave as a fire approaches, dial 911. Then don an N95 respirator to help reduce smoke and particle inhalation. During: Listen for emergency alerts. Stay inside. Go to the safest building or room with the lowest smoke levels. Crouch low for the best air. If you don&#x27;t have a mask, breathe through a wet cloth. If you are caught outside, try to find a body of water to crouch in. If you can&#x27;t, find a depression with the least vegetation and lie low, covering yourself with wet blankets, clothes, or soil if possible. After: Do not return until instructed to do so. Listen to authorities before drinking water from the area. Avoid items that are hot, smoky, or charred. Text friends and family, but don\u2019t call. Lines may be busy. Wear a dust mask and document",
