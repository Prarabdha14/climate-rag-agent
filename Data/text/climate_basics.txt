Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns
— primarily caused today by human activities such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil,
and gas), deforestation, and intensive agriculture. These activities increase atmospheric
greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, trapping extra heat and raising
global average temperatures (global warming).

Major impacts include rising sea levels, more frequent and intense heatwaves,
changes to precipitation patterns (more floods in some regions and droughts in others),
glacier and polar ice loss, ocean warming and acidification, and greater risks to
agriculture, human health, and biodiversity. Mitigation (reducing emissions) and
adaptation (preparing for impacts) are both needed to manage risks and protect
vulnerable communities and ecosystems.
